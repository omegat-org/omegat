  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>LanguageTool is an Open Source style and grammar proofreading
    software for English, French, German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, and a lot
    of other languages - see the list of supported languages (<ulink
    url="???">http://www.languagetool.org/languages/</ulink>) .</para>

    <para>You can think of LanguageTool as a software to detect errors that a
    simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now
    etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell
    checking. LanguageTool will find errors for which a rule has been defined
    in its language-specific configuration files. </para>

    <title>Installation and Use </title>

    <para>The LanguageTool plugin for OmegaT can be downloaded from the OmegaT
    plugins download site (<ulink
    url="???">http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat-plugins/files/</ulink>).
    Unzip the files, and put them all in the "plugins" folder located in
    OmegaT installation folder, that is the folder that contains the
    OmegaT.jar. Create the "plugins" folder first, if it does not
    exist.</para>

    <para>Once installed, the plugin will be used automatically by OmegaT, if
    <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Language Checker</guimenuitem> is checked. The
    rules applied (if any) will depend on the source and target language of
    the project. When a rule is triggered, the corresponding phrase will be
    underlined in blue in the Editor (see <emphasis>also </emphasis>and
    <emphasis>I didn't do nothing</emphasis> in the picture above). When
    hovering the mouse over the underlined phrase, an explanation will appear.
