    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para><ulink url="http://www.languagetool.org">LanguageTool</ulink> is an
    Open Source style and grammar proofreading software for English, French,
    German, Polish, Dutch, Romanian, and a number of other languages - see the
    <ulink url="http://www.languagetool.org/languages/">list of supported
    languages</ulink>.</para>

    <para>You can think of LanguageTool as a software to detect errors that a
    simple spell checker cannot detect, e.g. mixing up there/their, no/now
    etc. It can also detect some grammar mistakes. It does not include spell
    checking. LanguageTool will find errors for which a rule has been defined
    in its language-specific configuration files.</para>

    <title>Installation and Use</title>

    <para>The LanguageTool plugin is included in OmegaT. It will be used automatically by OmegaT if <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Language Checker</guimenuitem> is checked. The
    rules applied (if any) will depend on the source and target language of
    the project. When a rule is triggered, the corresponding phrase will be
    underlined in blue in the Editor (see <emphasis>also </emphasis>and
    <emphasis>I didn't do nothing</emphasis> in the picture above). When
    hovering the mouse over the underlined phrase, an explanation will
    appear.</para>
    
	<warning>
		<title>Incompatibilities</title>
		<para>LanguageTool will not work properly if an old version is found in the /plugin folder. Remove LanguageTool from the /plugin folder before starting OmegaT.</para>
