    <para>OmegaT allows to run scripts written in different scripting
    languages.</para>

    <para>Clicking <guisubmenu>Tools &gt;
    </guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Scripting</guisubmenu> opens the Scripting
    window:<screenshot>
        <screeninfo>Scripting window</screeninfo>

    <para>The Scripting window allows you to load an existing script into the
    text area and run it against the current opened project. To customize the
    script feature, do the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Load a script into the editor by clicking on its name in the
        list on the left panel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Right-click on a button from "&lt;1&gt;" to "&lt;12&gt;" in the
        bottom panel and select "Add". In the above example, two scripts
        (position 1 and 2) have already been added.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you left-click on the number, the selected script will run.
        You can start the selected macros from the main menu as well by using
        their entries in the <guisubmenu>Tools </guisubmenu>menu or by
        pressing<keycap> Ctrl+Alt+F#</keycap> (# 1 to 12).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By default, scripts are stored in the "scripts" folder located in
    OmegaT installation folder (the folder that contains the OmegaT.jar).
    </para>

    <para>You can add new scripts there, so they will appear in the list of
    available scripts in the Scripting window.</para>

    <title>Scripting languages</title>

    <para>The following scripting languages have been implemented:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Groovy</emphasis>
          (http://groovy.codehaus.org): is a dynamic language for the Java
          Virtual machine. It builds upon the strengths of Java but has
          additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby
          and Smalltalk.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">JavaScript</emphasis> (sometimes
          abbreviated JS, not to be confused with Java): is a prototype-based
          scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class
          functions. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting
          object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
          Being the language behind popular software such as Firefox it is a
          familiar and preferred programming tool in the open-source
          domain.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>All the languages have access to the OmegaT object model,
    with the project as the top object. The following code snippet in groovy
    for instance scans through all the segments in all files in the current
    project and, if the translation exists, prints out the source and the
    target of the segment:</para>

    <programlisting>    files = project.projectFiles;
    for (i in 0 ..&lt; files.size())
    {
        for (j in 0 ..&lt; files[i].entries.size())
        {
            currSegment = files[i].entries[j];
            if (project.getTranslationInfo(currSegment))
            {
                source = currSegment.getSrcText();
                target = project.getTranslationInfo(currSegment).translation;
                console.println(source + " &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; " + target);
            }     
        }
    }</programlisting>
