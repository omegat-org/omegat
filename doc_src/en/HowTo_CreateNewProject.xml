  <title>Create a new Project</title>

    <para>To start using OmegaT, first create a project that will hold all
    your files, such as your source file, translation memories, glossaries,
    and eventually your translated file. In the <guimenu>Project</guimenu>
    menu, select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>New...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
    and type a name for your project. Remember where you are
    creating the project, because you will need to return to it later.</para>

    <para>After you give your project a name, the <guilabel>Create New Project</guilabel> dialog
    will open. At the top of that dialog, select your source file's language
    and the language that your translated file will be, and click
    <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue.</para>

    <para>If you are interested in other settings of this dialog, you can return
    to it any time by pressing
    <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

    <para>Next, the <guilabel>Project Files</guilabel> dialog opens. Click on
    <guibutton>Copy Files to Source Folder...</guibutton> to select your source
    files. OmegaT will then copy the selected files to the <filename
    class="directory">source</filename> subfolder of your newly created
    project. After the source files have loaded in the
    <guilabel>Editor</guilabel> pane, you can close the <guilabel>Project
    Files</guilabel> dialog.</para>
