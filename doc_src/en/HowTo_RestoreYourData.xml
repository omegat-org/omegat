  <warning><para>OmegaT is a robust and trustworthy application, but even so, it is smart take precautions to guard against data loss when using it, just as with any other application.</para></warning>

	<para>OmegaT regularly and automatically stores all your progress in the <link linkend="project.folder.project.save.tmx"
	endterm="project.folder.project.save.tmx.title"/>
	file located in the project’s <link linkend="project.folder.omegat"
	endterm="project.folder.omegat.title"/> folder. OmegaT also creates regular backups of that file.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem><para>When you open a project, OmegaT backs-up <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> into a timestamped backup file.</para>
	  <para>OmegaT keeps up to 10 of those files.</para>
	  <note><para>The backup filename follows the pattern <filename>project_save.tmx.YYYYMMDDhhmm.bak</filename> where <code>YYYY</code>
	  represents the 4-digit year, <code>MM</code> the month, <code>DD</code> the day of the month, and <code>hh</code>
	  and <code>mm</code> indicate the hours and minutes.</para></note>

  <listitem>
	  <para>Every time <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> has been modified: either after using <link linkend="menus.project.save" endterm="menus.project.save.title"/>, or as a regular backup every 3 minutes by default, OmegaT creates a backup with the name <filename>project_save.tmx.bak</filename>. That file is a copy of <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> <emphasis>before</emphasis> the modification.</para>

	<para>Everytime you use <link linkend="menus.project.save" endterm="menus.project.save.title"/>, or as a regular backup every 3 minutes by default, OmegaT saves the current state of the translation into <filename>project_save.tmx</filename></para>

	<para>The file <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> always contains the most recent data.</para>

	<title id="how.to.restore.your.data.lost.in.translation.title">You lost your translation?</title>
	<para>If you believe that you have lost translation data, it might probably be safely stored in your most recent backup memory, which is usually less than a few minutes old or so.</para>

	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Close the project, preventing on any modification on the current status of the backup files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Rename the current <filename>project_save.tmx </filename>file (to
		<filename>project_save.tmx.tmp</filename>, for example).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Select the backup translation memory most likely to contain the data
		you are looking for.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Rename it <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Reopen the project.</para>
      </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	</para>

	<para>This action will restore the status of the translation to the moment on which the selected backup was created. You may repeat this operation as needed for locating older situations. Keep an eye on safely storing all the different files you are renaming for eventual reuse. Also remember not modifying the project configuration or adding TMX files on the meantime, as that may affect the results.</para>

	<title id="how.to.restore.your.data.project.wont.open.title">Your project won't open?</title>
	<para>In rare cases where your computer freezes and OmegaT does not have the time to properly close, some important files can be broken and keep your project from reopening after you have rebooted your machine.</para>

	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Create a new project with the same settings.</para>
      </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Copy the contents of the various user folders to their equivalent in the new project (source files, reference translation memory files, glossary files).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>In the old project, select the translation memory (backup or not) most likely
		to contain the data you are looking for.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Rename it <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Copy it to the <filename>omegat/</filename> folder of your new project.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Open the new project the project.</para>
      </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>This action will restore in the new project the status of the translation to the moment on which the selected project translation memory was created in the old project.</para>

	<title id="how.to.restore.your.data.translated.file.broken.title">Your translated file won't open?</title>
	<para>Very often, office suite files contain tags that must be copied into the translation to ensure that the translated file can be opened in the original application. In some cases, missing tags will keep the file from opening.</para>
	
	<para>Proceed as follows:
	<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
		<para>Open the project in OmegaT.</para>
      </listitem>

	  <listitem>
		<para>Use <link linkend="menus.tools.check.issues" endterm="menus.tools.check.issues.title"/> and focus on <guilabel>Tag issues</guilabel> .</para>

      <listitem>
		<para>Fix all the tag issues that were found in your documents.</para>

		<para>Use <link linkend="menus.project.create.translated.documents" endterm="menus.project.create.translated.documents.title"/> to recreate the documents.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
		<para>Open the documents again in the original application.</para>
      </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	</para>

	<para>This action will fix the internal tag consistency issues that might have been induced by not properly inserting the tags in the translation while in OmegaT.</para>

      <listitem>

	<note><para>Be very cautious about making changes to the files in the source
	folder, to the segmentation rules, or to the file filters, partway through
	a project. Modifying either after you have started your translation could
	result in OmegaT becoming unable to find a segment that you have already
	translated.</para></note>
