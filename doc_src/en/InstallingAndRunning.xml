      <para>To install <application>OmegaT</application>, double-click on the
      program you have downloaded.</para>

      <para>At the beginning of the installation you can select the language to
      be used during the installation. In the following window you can indicate
      that the language selected is to be used in OmegaT. If you check the
      corresponding checkbox, the <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file is
      modified to use the language selected (see next section for
      details). Later, after you have accepted the license agreement, the setup
      program asks you whether you wish to create a folder in the
      <emphasis>Start</emphasis> menu, and whether you wish to create a shortcut
      on the desktop and in the quick launch bar - you can create these
      shortcuts later by dragging <filename>OmegaT.exe</filename> to the desktop
      or to the Start menu to link it from there. The last frame offers you to
      have a look at the readme and changes files for the version you have
      installed.</para>

      <title>Running <application>OmegaT</application></title>

      <para>Once <application>OmegaT</application> is installed, you can click
      on <filename>OmegaT.jar</filename> to launch it directly or you can launch
      it directly from the command line.</para>

      <para>The simplest way to launch OmegaT, however, is to execute the
      <filename>OmegaT.exe</filename> program.  The options for the program
      start-up in this case will be read from the
      <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file, which resides in the same folder
      as the exe file and which you can edit to reflect your setup. The
      following example for the INI file reserves 1 GB of memory, requests French
      as the user language and Canada as the country:</para>

      <programlisting># OmegaT.exe runtime configuration
# To use a parameter, remove the '#' before the '-'
# Memory
-Xmx1024M
# Language
-Duser.language=FR
# Country
-Duser.country=CA</programlisting>

      <para>Advice: if OmegaT works slowly in Remote Desktop sessions under
      Windows, you may use this option:</para>

      <title>Upgrading OmegaT</title>

      Windows versions of OmegaT. It does not apply to the Web Start versions,
      which are upgraded automatically, nor to cross-platform versions
      installed on Windows.</emphasis></para>

      <para>If you already have a version of OmegaT installed on your PC and
      wish to upgrade to a more recent version, you have two options:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Install over the existing
          installation.</emphasis> To do this, simply select the same
          installation folder as the existing installation when installing the
          new version. The "old" version of OmegaT will be overwritten, but any
          settings from it will be retained. This includes preferences set from
          within OmegaT, any changes you have made to your
          <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file, and also your launch script
          (<filename>.bat</filename> file), if you are using one.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>With this method, you may also download the "Windows without JRE"
      version, since the new installation will use your existing JRE.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Install to a new folder.</emphasis> This
          will enable you to keep both versions side-by-side, which you may wish
          to do until you feel comfortable with the new version. This method

    Environment (JRE) used. To start OmegaT for the first time with Java Web
    Start, load the following URL in your browser:</para>

    <para>Download the file <filename>OmegaT.jnlp</filename> and then click on

    the permissions you give to the local version, i.e., they allow access to
    the hard drive of the computer. Subsequent clicks on
    <filename>OmegaT.jnlp</filename> will check for any upgrades, install them,

    <para>Normally, it is not necessary to start
    <application>OmegaT</application> from the command line. However, the
    command-line alternative allows the user to control and modify the
    program's behavior. There are two ways of launching
    <application>OmegaT</application> using the command line.</para>

    <section id="method1.opening.commandline.window">
      <title>Opening a command line window</title>

      <para>A command line window is also referred to as a "terminal window".
      On Windows it is called an "MS-DOS window" and is available from the Start
      Menu, inside Programs, through the "MS-DOS" item. The macOS equivalent is
      the application Terminal located in
      <filename>Applications/Utilities</filename>.</para>

      <para>To launch <application>OmegaT</application>, you must normally
      type two commands. The first of these is:</para>

      <programlisting>cd <parameter>folder</parameter></programlisting>

      <para>where <parameter>folder</parameter> is the name of the folder, with
      complete path, in which your <application>OmegaT</application> program -
      specifically, the file <filename>OmegaT.jar</filename> - is located.  In
      practice, this command will therefore be something like this:</para>

      <para>On Windows</para>

      <programlisting>cd C:\Program Files\OmegaT</programlisting>

      <para>On macOS</para>

      <programlisting>cd <parameter>&lt;OmegaT.app location&gt;</parameter>/OmegaT.app/Contents/Resources/Java/</programlisting>

      <para>On Linux</para>

      <programlisting>cd /usr/local/omegat</programlisting>

      <para>This command changes the folder to the folder containing the
      executable <application>OmegaT</application> file. The second command is
      the command which actually launches <application>OmegaT</application>.
      In its most basic form, this command is:</para>

      <programlisting>java -jar OmegaT.jar</programlisting>

      <para>Pay attention to the capitalization - in OS other than Windows, the
      program will not start, if you enter <literal>omegat</literal> instead of
      <literal>OmegaT</literal>!</para>

      <para>This method has a particular benefit of being suitable for finding
      causes of problems: if an error occurs during use of the program, an
      error message is output in the terminal window which may contain useful
      information on the cause of the error.</para>

      <para>The above method somewhat impractical way of launching a program
      routinely. For this reason, the two commands described above are contained
      in a file (a "script", also called a "<filename>.bat</filename> file" on
      Windows systems).</para>

      <para>When this file is executed, the commands within it are
      automatically carried out. Consequently, to make changes to the launch
      command, it is sufficient to modify the file.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="launch.command.arguments">
      <title>Launch command arguments</title>

      <para>The basic command has already been mentioned above. Changes to this
      command involve the addition of "arguments" to it. Arguments are added
      after the initial <command>java</command>, and before the <literal>-jar
      OmegaT.jar</literal>. Note that in Windows you can change the
      <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file to reflect your preferences. In
      other platforms, you can modify
      <filename>Configuration.properties</filename> file on the Mac, or
      <filename>OmegaT</filename> launcher under Linux to do the same.</para>

      <para>A list of possible arguments is given below. Advanced users can
      obtain more information on the arguments by typing <emphasis>man
      java</emphasis> in the terminal window.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">User interface language

          <para><emphasis
          role="bold"><literal>-Duser.language=<parameter>XX</parameter></literal></emphasis>
          Normally, i.e. when <application>OmegaT</application> is launched
          without any arguments, the program first detects the language of the
          user's operating system. If a user interface in this language is
          available, <application>OmegaT</application> uses it. So, if the
          user's operating system is Russian and
          <application>OmegaT</application> has been localized in Russian,
          <application>OmegaT</application> is displayed with a Russian user
          interface, Russian menus, etc. If the language of the user's system is
          not available, <application>OmegaT</application> defaults to
          English. This is the standard behavior.</para>

          <para>The <literal>-Duser.language=<parameter>XX</parameter></literal>
          argument causes <application>OmegaT</application> to use the language
          specified rather than the language of the user's operating
          system. <parameter>XX</parameter> in the command stands for the
          two-digit code of the desired language. To launch
          <application>OmegaT</application> with a French interface (for example
          on a Russian operating system), the command would therefore be:</para>

          <programlisting>java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</programlisting>

          Besides the language, you can also specify the country, for example
          <literal>CN</literal> or <literal>TW</literal> in case of the Chinese
          language. To display the instant start guide in the desired language,
          you need to specify both the language and the country. This is
          necessary even if there's only one combination available, like
          <literal>pt_BR</literal> in case of Brazilian Portuguese.</para>
