  <para>An OmegaT project is a folder containing files and subfolders.</para>

  <section id="projectfolder.source">
    <title>source</title>

    <para>The source subfolder contains files to be translated. You can add
    the files to it later. Note that the structure of the source subfolder may
    take any form you like. If the files to be translated are parts of a tree
    structure (as in a website), you need only specify the top-level subfolder
    and OmegaT will maintain the entire contents, while keeping the tree
    structure intact.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="projectfolder.target">
    <title>target</title>

    <para>This subfolder is initially empty. To add contents to it, select
    <menuchoice>
        <shortcut>
          <keycombo>
            <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

            <keycap>D</keycap>
          </keycombo>
        </shortcut>

        <guimenu>Project</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Create Translated Documents</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>. Files within the <filename class="directory">source</filename> folder,
    whether translated or not, are then generated here, with the same
    hierarchy as present in the source subfolder. The contents of the target
    subfolder will reflect the current state of the translation, as present in
    the project translation memory, saved in the current <filename>/omegat/project_save.tmx</filename>. Untranslated segments
    will hereby remain in the source language.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="projectfolder.tm">
    <title>tm</title>

    <para>The <filename class="directory">tm</filename> folder can contain any number of ancillary translation
    memories - i.e. tmx files. Such files can be created in any of the three
    varieties indicated above. Note that other CAT tools can export (and
    import as well) tmx files, usually in all three forms. The best thing of
    course is to use OmegaT-specific TMX files (see above), so that the
    in-line formatting within the segment is retained.</para>

    <para>The contents of translation memories in the <filename class="directory">tm</filename> subfolder serve to
    generate suggestions for the text(s) to be translated. Any text, already
    translated and stored in those files, will appear among the fuzzy matches,
    if it is sufficiently similar to the text currently being
    translated.</para>

    <para>If the source segment in one of the ancillary TMs is identical to
    the text being translated, OmegaT acts as defined in the <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>Options</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Editing Behavior...</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> dialog window. For instance (if the default is accepted),
    the translation from the ancillary TM is accepted and prefixed
    with <emphasis>[fuzzy]</emphasis>, so that the translator can review the
    translations at a later stage and check whether the segments tagged this
    way, have been translated correctly.</para>

    <para>It may happen, that translation memories, available in the
    <filename class="directory">tm</filename> subfolder, contain segments with identical source
    text, but differing targets. TMX files are read sorted by their names and
    segments within a given TMX file line by line. The last segment with the
    identical source text will thus prevail (Note: of course it makes more
    sense to avoid this to happen in the first place).</para>

    <para>Note that the TMX files in the <filename class="directory">tm</filename> folder can be compressed with
    gzip.</para>

    <section id="projectfolder.tmauto">
      <title>tm/auto</title>

      <para>If it is clear from the very start, that translations in a given
      TM (or TMs) are all correct, one can put them into the <filename class="directory">tm/auto</filename> folder and avoid confirming a lot
      of <emphasis>[fuzzy]</emphasis> cases.</para>

      <para><orderedlist>

      <para>Note: if TMX is removed from <filename class="directory">tm/auto</filename> before step 3, no extra
      Translation Unit is added.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="projectfolder.tmenforce">
      <title>tm/enforce</title>

      <para>If you have no doubt that a TMX is more accurate than the
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> of OmegaT, put this TMX in
      <filename class="directory">tm/enforce</filename> to overwrite existing default translations
      unconditionally.</para>

    <section id="projectfolder.tmmt">
      <title>tm/mt</title>

      <para>In the editor pane, when a match is inserted from a TMX contained
      in a folder named <filename class="directory">mt</filename>, the background of the active
      segment is changed to red. The background is restored to normal when the
      segment is left.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="projectfolder.tmpenalty">
      <title>tm/penalty-xxx</title>

      <para>Sometimes, it is useful to distinguish between high-quality
      translation memories and those that are, because of the subject matter,
      client, revision status, etc., less reliable. For translation memories
      in folders with a name <filename class="directory">penalty-xxx</filename> (with xxx
      between 0 and 100), matches will be degraded according to the name of
      the folder: a 100% match in any of TMs, residing in a folder called
      <filename class="directory">penalty-30</filename> for instance, will be lowered to a 70%
      match. The penalty applies to all three match percentages: matches 75,
      80, 90 will in this case be lowered to 45, 50, 60.</para>

  <section id="projectfolder.dictionary">
    <title>dictionary</title>

    <para>Initially empty, this folder will contain dictionaries you have
    added to the project. See <link

    subject.</para>

  <section id="projectfolder.omegat">
    <title>omegat</title>

    <para>The <filename class="directory">omegat</filename> subfolder contains at
    least one and possibly several other files. The most important file here
    is the <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>, that is the working
    translation memory for the project. Backups of this file (with extension
    bak) are added progressively to this subfolder, first at the beginning of
    the translation session, at its end, and while the translation
    progresses.</para>

    <para>During translation additional files may get created in this
    subfolder as follows</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
