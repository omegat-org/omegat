    and languages.</para>

    <para>It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation
    session. Note that changes to the project setup may have some
    consequences, especially, when the project has already been started. Until
    you have some experience with OmegaT, it is safest to consider all
    settings final once the translation has started – unless of course you
    realize a major mistake has been made. See the section Preventing data
    loss for ways and means of protecting your work.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Languages</title>

    <para>You can either enter the source and target languages by hand or use
    the drop down menus. Bear in mind that changing the languages may render
    the currently used translation memories useless since their language pair
    may not longer match the new languages.</para>

    <para>Tokenizers corresponding to the selected languages are displayed.
    See <link linkend="appendix.Tokenizers.inOmegaT">Tokenizers
    Appendix</link> for details.</para>

        <term>Enable Sentence-level segmentation</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The segmentation settings only address the way the source
          files are handled by <application>OmegaT</application>. The
          predominant way of segmenting the sources is the sentence-level
          segmenting, so this check box should in a normal case be left
          checked.</para>

          <para>In some seldom cases the alternative, i.e. segmenting by
          paragraphs, may be preferred. Changing this flag does not modify the
          segmentation of already existing translation memories. If you decide
          mid-translation to switch from sentence to paragraph translation,
          the internal translation memory of the project will not be changed
          (OmegaT may upgrade old translation memories that did not use
          sentence segmentation, but not vice versa).</para>

          <para>Changing segmentation settings may cause some already
          translated segments to be split or merged. This will effectively
          return them to the "untranslated" status, as they will no longer
          match segments recorded in the project memory, even though their
          original translation is still there.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The segmentation rules are generally valid across all the
          projects. The user, however, may need to generate a set of rules,
          specific to the project in question. Use this button to open a
          dialog, activate the check box <guimenuitem>Project specific
          segmentation rules</guimenuitem>, then proceed to adjust the
          segmentation rules as desired. The new set of rules will be stored
          together with the project and will not interfere with the general
          set of segmentation rules. To delete project specific segmentation
          rules, uncheck the check box. See chapter <link
          linkend="chapter.segmentation">Source Segmentation</link> for more
          information on segmentation rules. </para>

          <para><emphasis>Hint:</emphasis> the set of segmentation rules for a
          given project is stored as

          </indexterm></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>In a similar fashion as above the user can create
          project-specific File filters, which will be stored together with
          the project and will be valid for the current project only. To
          create a project-specific set of file filters, click on the
          <guibutton>File filter ... </guibutton>button, then activate
          <guimenuitem>Enable project specific filters</guimenuitem> check box
          in the window, that opens. A copy of the changed filters
          configuration will be stored with the project. To delete project
          specific file filters, uncheck the check box. Note that in the menu
          <guimenuitem>Options-&gt;File Filters</guimenuitem>, the global user
          filters are changed, not the project filters. See chapter<link
          linkend="chapter.file.filters"> File filters </link>for more on the
          subject. <emphasis/></para>

        <term>Auto-propagation of Translations</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>In case there are non-unique segments in source documents, the
          Auto-propagation check box offers the user the following two
          possibilities as regards automatic translation: if checked, the
          first translated segment will be assumed as the default translation
          and its target text will be automatically used for later hits during
          the translation process. Mistranslated segments can of course be
          corrected later manually using <guimenuitem>Create Alternative
          Translation</guimenuitem>. If the Auto-propagation check box is not
          checked, the segments with alternative translations are left
          untranslated until the user has decided which translation is to be
          used.</para>

        <term>Remove Tags</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>When enabled, all the formatting tags are removed from source
          segments. This is especially useful when dealing with texts where
          inline formatting is not really useful (e.g., OCRed PDF, bad
          converted .odt or .docx, etc.) In a normal case it should always be
          possible to open the target documents, as only inline tags are
          removed. Non-visible formatting (i.e., which doesn't appear as tags
          in the OmegaT editor) is retained in target documents.</para>

  <section>
    <title>File locations</title>

    <para>Here you can select different subfolders, for instance the subfolder
    with source files, subfolder for target files etc. If you enter names of
    folders that do not exist yet, <application>OmegaT</application> creates
    them for you. In case you decide to modify project folders, keep in mind
    that this will not move existing files from old folders to the new
    location.</para>

    <para>Clic on <guibutton>Exclusions...</guibutton> to define the files or
    folders that will be ignored by <application>OmegaT</application>. An
    ignored file or folder:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>is not displayed in the Editor pane,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>is not taken into account in statistics,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>is not copied in /target folder during the translated files
        creation process.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In the Exclusion patterns dialog, it is possible to Add or Remove a
    pattern, or edit one by selecting a line and pressing F2. It is possible
    to use standard wildcards (and ?) plus *, using the <ulink
