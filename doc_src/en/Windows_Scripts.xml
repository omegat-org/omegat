    <title>Use</title>

    <para>The Scripting window allows you to load an existing script into the text area and run it against the current opened project. To customize the scripting feature, do the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Load a script into the editor by clicking its name in the list in the left-hand panel.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Right-click a button from <guilabel>&lt;1&gt;</guilabel> to <guilabel>&lt;12&gt;</guilabel> in the bottom panel and select <guilabel>Add Script</guilabel>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you left-click the number, the selected script will run. You can also start the selected macros from the main menu by using their entries in the <guisubmenu>Tools</guisubmenu> menu or by pressing <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F#</keycap></keycombo> (# 1 to 12).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>By default, scripts are stored in the <filename class="directory">scripts</filename> folder located in the OmegaT installation folder (the folder that contains the <filename>OmegaT.jar</filename> file).</para>

    <para>If you add new scripts there, they will appear in the list of available scripts in the <guilabel>Scripting</guilabel> window.</para>

    <para>Some additional scripts can be found here: <ulink url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegatscripts/">OmegaT
    Scripts</ulink></para>

    <title>Scripting languages</title>

    <para>The following scripting languages have been implemented:</para>

    <para><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Groovy</emphasis> (http://groovy.codehaus.org): a dynamic language for the Java Virtual machine. It builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">JavaScript</emphasis> (sometimes abbreviated JS, not to be confused with Java): a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. Being the language behind popular software such as Firefox, it is a familiar and preferred programming tool in the open-source domain.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>All the languages have access to the OmegaT object model, with the project as the top object. For example, the following Groovy code snippet scans through all the segments in all the files in the current project and, if a translation exists, prints out the source and the target of the segment:</para>

    <programlisting>    files = project.projectFiles;
    for (i in 0 ..&lt; files.size())
    {
        for (j in 0 ..&lt; files[i].entries.size())
        {
            currSegment = files[i].entries[j];
            if (project.getTranslationInfo(currSegment))
            {
                source = currSegment.getSrcText();
                target = project.getTranslationInfo(currSegment).translation;
                console.println(source + &quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot; + target);
            }     
        }
    }</programlisting>
