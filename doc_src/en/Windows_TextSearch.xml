  <section id="using.wild.cards">
    <title>Using wild cards</title>

    <para>In both exact and keyword searches, the wild card search characters
    '*' and '?' can be used. They have the meaning, familiar to Word
    users:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>'*' matches zero or more characters, from the current position
        in a given word to its end. The search term <literal>'run*'</literal>
        for example would match words <literal>'run'</literal>,
        <literal>'runs'</literal> and <literal>'running'</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>'?' matches any single character. For instance,
        <literal>'run?'</literal> would match the word
        <literal>'runs'</literal> and <literal>'runn'</literal> in the word
        <literal>'running'</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The matches will be displayed in bold blue. Note that '*' and '?'
    have special meaning in regular expressions, so wild card search, as
    described here, applies to exact and keyword search only (see
    below).</para>
  </section>

  <section id="search.methoids">
    <title>Search methods and options</title>

    <para>Select the method using the radio buttons. The following search
    methods are available:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>exact search</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Search for segments containing the exact string you specified.
          An exact search looks for a phrase, i.e. if several words are
          entered, they are found only if they occur in exactly that sequence.
          Searching for <literal>open file</literal> will thus find all
          occurrences of the string <emphasis><literal>open
          file</literal></emphasis>, but not <emphasis><literal>file
          opened</literal></emphasis> or <emphasis><literal>open input
          file</literal></emphasis>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>keyword search</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Search for segments containing all keywords you specified, in
          any order. Select keyword search to search for any number of
          individual full words, in any order. OmegaT displays a list of all
          segments containing all of the words specified. Keyword searches are
          similar to a search &quot;with all of the words&quot; in an Internet search
          engine such as Google (AND logic). Using keyword search with
          <emphasis><literal>open file</literal></emphasis> will thus find all
          occurrences of the string <emphasis><literal>open
          file</literal>,</emphasis> as well as <emphasis><literal>file
          opened</literal>, <literal>open input file</literal>, <literal>file
          may not be safe to open</literal></emphasis>, etc.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="bold">regular expressions</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The search string will be treated as a regular expression. The
          search string - [a-zA-Z]+[öäüqwß] - in the example above for
          instance looks for words in the target segment, containing
          questionable characters from German keyboard. <link linkend="appendix.regexp">Regular expressions</link> are a powerful
          way to look for instances of a string.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Additionally to one of the methods above you can select the
    following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>case sensitive</guilabel>: the search will
        be performed for the exact string specified; i.e. capitalization is
        observed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Space matches nbsp</guilabel>: when this
        option is checked, a space character put in search entry can match
        either a normal space character or a non-breacking space (\u00A)
        character.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>in source</guilabel>: search in the source
        segments</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>in translations</guilabel>: search in the
        target segments</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>in notes</guilabel>: search in notes to
        segments</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>in comments</guilabel>: search in comments
        to segments</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Translated or untranslated</guilabel>:
        search in both translated and untranslated segments.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Translated</guilabel>: search only in
        translated segments.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Untranslated</guilabel>: search only in
        untranslated segments.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Display: all matching segments</guilabel>:
        if checked, all the segments are displayed one by one, even
        if they are present several times in the same document or in different
        documents.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Display: file names</guilabel>: if
        checked, the name of the file where each segment is found is displayed
        above each result.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Search in Project</guilabel>: check
        <guilabel>Memory</guilabel> to include the project memory
        (<filename>project_save.tmx</filename> file) in the search. Check <guilabel>TMs</guilabel>
        to include the translation memories located in the
        <filename class="directory">tm</filename> folder in the search. Check
        <guilabel>Glossaries</guilabel> to include the glossaries located in
        the <filename class="directory">glossary</filename> folder in the search.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><guilabel>Search in Files</guilabel>: search in a
        single file or a folder containing a set of files. When searching
        through files (as opposed to translation memories), OmegaT restricts
        the search to files in source file formats. Consequently, although
        OmegaT is quite able to handle <filename>tmx</filename> files, it does
        not include them in the Search files search.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you click on the button <guibutton>Advanced options</guibutton>
    additional criteria (author or changer of the translation, date
    translated, excluding orphan segments, etc) can be selected. When
    <guilabel>Full/Half width char insensitive</guilabel> option is checked,
    searches for fullwidth forms (CJK characters) will match halfwidth forms
    and vice versa.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="search.result.display">
    <title>Search results display</title>

    <para>Pressing the search button after entering a string in the search
    field displays all the segments in the project that include the entered
    string. As OmegaT handles identical segments as
    one single entity, only the first unique segment is shown. The segments
    are displayed in order of appearance in the project. Translated segments
    are displayed with the original text at the top and the translated text at
    the bottom, untranslated segments are displayed as the source only.</para>

    <para>Double-clicking on a segment opens it in the Editor for
    modifications (one single click does it when <guilabel role="bold">Auto-sync with Editor</guilabel> option is checked). You can
    then switch back to the Search window for the next segment found, for
    instance to check and, if necessary, correct the terminology.</para>

    <para>In the Search window, you can use standard shortcuts (<keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

        <keycap>N</keycap>
      </keycombo>, <keycombo>
        <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

        <keycap>P</keycap>
      </keycombo>) to move from one segment to another.</para>

    <para>You may have several Search windows open at the same time. You can
    quickly see their contents by looking at their title: it will contain the
    search term used.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="search.filter">
    <title>Filter entries in editor according to search</title>

    <para>For easier navigation in the search result set, you can apply the
    search to the editor. Press the <guibutton>Filter</guibutton>
    button on the bottom to limit the shown entries in the editor window to
    those that match the current search. You can use normal navigation to go
    to e.g. the next (untranslated) segment that matches the search
    criteria.</para>

    <para>NB:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A search may be limited to 1000 items, so if you search on a
        common phrase, the editor then shows only those 1000 matching entries,
        and not all entries that match the search criteria.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A file might have no matching entries, so it will show
        empty.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If a search removes duplicates, those duplicates will not be in
        the Editor.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To remove a filter, press the <guibutton>Remove filter</guibutton> button, or reload a project.</para>
