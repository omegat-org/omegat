      <para>To install OmegaT, double-click on the
      program you have downloaded.</para>

      <para>At the beginning of the installation you can select the language to
      be used during the installation. In the following window you can indicate
      that the language selected is to be used in OmegaT. If you check the
      corresponding checkbox, the <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file is
      modified to use the language selected (see next section for
      details). Later, after you have accepted the license agreement, the setup
      program asks you whether you wish to create a folder in the
      <emphasis>Start</emphasis> menu, and whether you wish to create a shortcut
      on the desktop and in the quick launch bar - you can create these
      shortcuts later by dragging <filename>OmegaT.exe</filename> to the desktop
      or to the Start menu to link it from there. The last frame offers you to
      have a look at the readme and changes files for the version you have
      installed.</para>

      <title>Running OmegaT</title>

      <para>Once OmegaT is installed, you can click
      on <filename>OmegaT.jar</filename> to launch it directly or you can launch
      it directly from the command line.</para>

      <para>The simplest way to launch OmegaT, however, is to execute the
      <filename>OmegaT.exe</filename> program.  The options for the program
      start-up in this case will be read from the
      <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file, which resides in the same folder
      as the exe file and which you can edit to reflect your setup. The
      following example for the INI file reserves 1 GB of memory, requests French
      as the user language and Canada as the country:</para>

      <programlisting># OmegaT.exe runtime configuration
# To use a parameter, remove the '#' before the '-'
# Memory
-Xmx1024M
# Language
-Duser.language=FR
# Country
-Duser.country=CA</programlisting>

      <para>Advice: if OmegaT works slowly in Remote Desktop sessions under
      Windows, you may use this option:</para>

      which are upgraded automatically, nor to cross-platform versions
      installed on Windows.</emphasis></para>

      <para>If you already have a version of OmegaT installed on your PC and
      wish to upgrade to a more recent version, you have two options:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Install over the existing
          installation.</emphasis> To do this, simply select the same
          installation folder as the existing installation when installing the
          new version. The "old" version of OmegaT will be overwritten, but any
          settings from it will be retained. This includes preferences set from
          within OmegaT, any changes you have made to your
          <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file, and also your launch script
          (<filename>.bat</filename> file), if you are using one.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>With this method, you may also download the "Windows without JRE"

          will enable you to keep both versions side-by-side, which you may wish
          to do until you feel comfortable with the new version. This method

    network. Java Web Start ensures that the latest version of the application
    will be deployed, as well as the correct version of the Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE) used. To start OmegaT for the first time with Java Web
    Start, load the following URL in your browser:</para>

    <para>Download the file <filename>OmegaT.jnlp</filename> and then click on

    (which may appear as "unrestricted access to the computer") are identical to
    the permissions you give to the local version, i.e., they allow access to
    the hard drive of the computer. Subsequent clicks on
    <filename>OmegaT.jnlp</filename> will check for any upgrades, install them,

    <para>Normally, it is not necessary to start
    OmegaT from the command line. However, the
    command-line alternative allows the user to control and modify the
    program's behavior. There are two ways of launching
    OmegaT using the command line.</para>

    <section id="method1.opening.commandline.window">
      <title>Opening a command line window</title>

      <para>A command line window is also referred to as a "terminal window".
      On Windows it is called an "MS-DOS window" and is available from the Start
      Menu, inside Programs, through the "MS-DOS" item. The macOS equivalent is
      the application Terminal located in
      <filename>Applications/Utilities</filename>.</para>

      <para>To launch OmegaT, you must normally
      type two commands. The first of these is:</para>

      <programlisting>cd <parameter>folder</parameter></programlisting>

      <para>where <parameter>folder</parameter> is the name of the folder, with
      complete path, in which your OmegaT program -
      specifically, the file <filename>OmegaT.jar</filename> - is located.  In
      practice, this command will therefore be something like this:</para>

      <programlisting>cd C:\Program Files\OmegaT</programlisting>

      <para>On macOS</para>

      <programlisting>cd <parameter>&lt;OmegaT.app location&gt;</parameter>/OmegaT.app/Contents/Resources/Java/</programlisting>

      <para>On Linux</para>

      <programlisting>cd /usr/local/omegat</programlisting>

      <para>This command changes the folder to the folder containing the
      executable OmegaT file. The second command is
      the command which actually launches OmegaT.
      In its most basic form, this command is:</para>

      <programlisting>java -jar OmegaT.jar</programlisting>

      <para>Pay attention to the capitalization - in OS other than Windows, the
      program will not start, if you enter <literal>omegat</literal> instead of
      <literal>OmegaT</literal>!</para>

      <para>This method has a particular benefit of being suitable for finding
      causes of problems: if an error occurs during use of the program, an
      error message is output in the terminal window which may contain useful
      information on the cause of the error.</para>

      <para>The above method somewhat impractical way of launching a program
      routinely. For this reason, the two commands described above are contained
      in a file (a "script", also called a "<filename>.bat</filename> file" on
      Windows systems).</para>

      <para>When this file is executed, the commands within it are
      automatically carried out. Consequently, to make changes to the launch
      command, it is sufficient to modify the file.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="launch.command.arguments">
      <title>Launch command arguments</title>

      <para>The basic command has already been mentioned above. Changes to this
      command involve the addition of "arguments" to it. Arguments are added
      after the initial <command>java</command>, and before the <literal>-jar
      OmegaT.jar</literal>. Note that in Windows you can change the
      <filename>OmegaT.l4J.ini</filename> file to reflect your preferences. In
      other platforms, you can modify
      <filename>Configuration.properties</filename> file on the Mac, or
      <filename>OmegaT</filename> launcher under Linux to do the same.</para>

      <para>A list of possible arguments is given below. Advanced users can
      obtain more information on the arguments by typing <emphasis>man
      java</emphasis> in the terminal window.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">User interface language
          </emphasis></para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><literal>-Duser.language=<parameter>XX</parameter></literal></emphasis>
          Normally, i.e. when OmegaT is launched
          without any arguments, the program first detects the language of the
          user's operating system. If a user interface in this language is
          available, OmegaT uses it. So, if the
          user's operating system is Russian and
          OmegaT has been localized in Russian,
          OmegaT is displayed with a Russian user
          interface, Russian menus, etc. If the language of the user's system is
          not available, OmegaT defaults to
          English. This is the standard behavior.</para>

          <para>The <literal>-Duser.language=<parameter>XX</parameter></literal>
          argument causes OmegaT to use the language
          specified rather than the language of the user's operating
          system. <parameter>XX</parameter> in the command stands for the
          two-digit code of the desired language. To launch
          OmegaT with a French interface (for example
          on a Russian operating system), the command would therefore be:</para>

          <programlisting>java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</programlisting>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">-Duser.country=<parameter>XX</parameter></emphasis>
          Besides the language, you can also specify the country, for example
          <literal>CN</literal> or <literal>TW</literal> in case of the Chinese
          language. To display the instant start guide in the desired language,
          you need to specify both the language and the country. This is
          necessary even if there's only one combination available, like
          <literal>pt_BR</literal> in case of Brazilian Portuguese.</para>

          of memory assigned, in megabytes. The command to launch
          OmegaT with assignment of 2048 MB (2 GB) of

  <title>Glossaries</title>

  <para>Glossaries are terminology files. They can be created and updated
  manually or imported from other projects.</para>

  <para>A given project can have any number of reference glossaries, but only
  one glossary, the project default glossary, will be directly writable from
  the OmegaT user interface.</para>

  <para>Regardless of the number of glossaries in a project, any term in a
  segment that has a match in a glossary will be displayed in the Glossary
  pane.</para>

  <section id="glossaries.defaultglossary">
    <title>Default glossary</title>

    <para>The default writable glossary is located in the the
    <filename class="directory">glossary</filename> project folder and is called
    <filename>glossary.txt</filename>.</para>

    <para>Its name and location can be modified in the project properties
    dialog but its extension must be <filename>.txt</filename> or
    <filename>.utf8</filename> and its location must be contained in the
    <filename class="directory">glossary</filename> project folder.</para>

    <para>The file does not need to exist when setting it, it will be created
    when adding the first glossary entry. If the file already exists, no
    attempt is done to verify the format or the character set of the file: the
    new entries will always be in tab-separated format and the file will be
    saved in UTF-8 encoding.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="glossaries.usage">
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the
    <filename class="directory">glossary</filename> folder after creating the project.
    OmegaT automatically detects glossary files in
    this folder when a project is opened.</para>

    <para>To add a new term to the writable glossary use
    <guimenuitem>Edit</guimenuitem> &gt; <guimenuitem>Create Glossary
    Entry</guimenuitem> (<keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap>). Newly added terms
    will be immediately recognized. To add new terms to reference glossaries,
    edit them in an external text editor. Newly added terms will be recognized
    as soon as the changes have been saved.</para>

    <para>The source term can be a multi-word term.</para>

    <para>The glossary function uses stemming to find matches. Deactivate
    <guimenuitem>Use stemming for glossary entries</guimenuitem> in the OmegaT
    global preferences to only find exact matches for a term.</para>

    <para>The source term is displayed before the " = " sign and the target
    terms after. Comments are displayed after a number and each on a separate
    line. Terms from the project writable glossary are displayed in bold face.
    Terms from the reference glossaries are displayed in normal face.</para>

    <para>To display the <guimenuitem>Autocompletion</guimenuitem> contextual
    menu for the glossary matches, hit the OS dependant key
    (<keycap>Escape</keycap> for macOS, <keycap>Ctrl+Space</keycap> for the
    other platforms).</para>

    <para>To underline matching terms in the source part of the segment use
    <guimenuitem>View</guimenuitem> &gt; <guimenuitem>Mark Glossary
    Matches</guimenuitem>. Right-click on the underlined term and select a
    target term to insert it at the cursor location in the target part of the
    segment.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="glossaries.fileformat">
    <title>File format</title>

    <para>OmegaT glossary files are simple plain text three-column lists with
    the source term in the first column, an optional target term in the second
    column and an optional comment in the third column.</para>

    <para>Plain text glossaries can be "tab separated values" (TSV) files or
    "comma separated values" (CSV) files. A third possible format is the "TBX"
    (TermBase eXchange) ISO standard.</para>

    <para>The project default writable glossary is always a TSV file saved in
    UTF-8 encoding.</para>

    <para>Glossaries are read in an encoding that depends on the file
    extension:</para>

  <title>Spell checker</title>

  <para>OmegaT has a built-in spell checker based on the spelling checker used
  in Apache OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird. It is
  consequently able to use the huge range of free spelling dictionaries
  available for these applications.</para>

  <section id="spellchecker.installingdictionaries">
    <title>Installing spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>Before the spell check function can be used, a suitable dictionary
    or dictionaries (i.e. for your target language) must be installed. To
    install spelling dictionaries, follow this procedure:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In your file manager, create a new folder in a suitable location
        in which to store spelling dictionaries (D:\Translations\spellcheckers
        in the example below).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In OmegaT, select <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
        Checking</guimenuitem>, then click <guibutton>Choose
        </guibutton> beside the Dictionary file folder field. Navigate to and
        select the folder you created for dictionaries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Place the dictionary files you wish to use in this folder. There
        are essentially two ways in which you can do this. You can either copy
        files manually, i.e. from elsewhere on your system, using your file
        manager; or you can use OmegaT's <emphasis role="bold">"Install new
        dictionary"</emphasis> function to provide a list of available
        dictionaries to select from. Note that the "Install" function requires
        an Internet connection. The selected languages will then be installed
        and will eventually appear in your spell checker setup window (this
        may take a while).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Copying the files manually makes sense if you already have suitable
    dictionary files on your system, for instance as part of your Apache OpenOffice,
    LibreOffice, Firefox or Thunderbird installation. It is simpler, however, to look for
    dictionaries online, using the <emphasis role="bold">URL of online
    dictionaries</emphasis> field:</para>

    <para>Clicking on <guibutton>Install new dictionary</guibutton> button
    will open the Dictionary installer window, where you can select the
    dictionaries you want to install.</para>

    <para>The names of the files must correspond to the language code of your
    target language as defined in the project properties dialog
    (<guimenu>Project &gt; Properties</guimenu>). For example, if you have
    selected ES-MX (Mexican Spanish) as the target language, the dictionary
    files must be named es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff. If you only have a standard
    Spanish dictionary available, with file names es_es.dic and es_es.aff for
    instance, you can copy these files to es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff, and the
    spelling dictionary will work. Note that this will of course check for the
    standard (Castillian) rather than for Mexican Spanish.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="spellchecker.usingdictionaries">
    <title>Using spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>There is no need to instruct OmegaT to use a particular spelling
    dictionary; OmegaT will use the correct language dictionary based upon the
    language codes of your project. Check however that the language codes are
    exactly the same: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR target
    setting, for example. If necessary, edit the file names of the dictionary
    or change your project's language settings.</para>

    <para>To enable the spell checker, select <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
    Checking</guimenuitem> and tick the <guilabel>Automatically check the
    spelling of text</guilabel> check box (see above).</para>

    <para>Right-clicking on an underlined word (Artund in the figure above)
    opens a drop-down menu listing suggestions for the correction (Art und).
    You can also instruct the spell checker to ignore all the occurrences of
    the mis-spelled word, or add it to the dictionary.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="spellchecker.hints">
    <title>Hints</title>

    <para>If the spell checker is not working, then make sure first that the
    check box <guilabel>"Automatically check the spelling of text"</guilabel>
    in the spell checker dialog (<guisubmenu>Options &gt; Spell
    checking...)</guisubmenu> is checked.</para>

    <para>Also check that the target language code of your project against the
    available vocabularies in the setup window. The spell checker uses the
    target language code to determine the language to be used : if the target
    language is Brazilian Portuguese (PT_BR), the subfolder with vocabularies
    must contain the two vocabulary files, called
    <filename>pt_br.aff</filename> and <filename>pt_br.dic</filename>.</para>

    <para>If you have already translated a large body of text, and then
    realize the target language code of the project does not match the spell
    checker's language code (you specified pt_BR as the language, but there
    are no pt_BR vocabularies, for instance) you can simply copy the two
    corresponding files and rename them (e.g. from
    <filename>pt_PT.aff</filename> and <filename>pt_PT.dic</filename> to
    <filename>pt_BR.aff</filename> and <filename>pt_BR.dic</filename>). Of
    course it is much wiser, to take a short break and download the correct
    versions of the spell checker.</para>

    <para>Note that <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> physically removes the
    selected vocabularies. If they are used by some other application on your
    system, they will disappear from that application, too. If, for whatever
    reason, you need to do this from time to time, it may make sense to copy
    the files involved to a different folder, reserved just for use by
    OmegaT.</para>

    <para>OmegaT generally does not use buttons to give you access to its
    functions. The functions are available from the menus and most of them
    have been assigned default shortcuts. You will only need a few minutes of
    working with OmegaT to remember the most frequent shortcuts, and you will
    always be able to learn new shortcuts from the menus.</para>
	<para>Almost all of OmegaT's shortcuts are customizable. You will just need
	to manually modify a settings file and copy it to your configuration
	folder. The whole procedure is explained below.</para>
	<para>OmegaT runs on mostly 3 platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and the
	shortcut slightly vary depending on the platform. To make reading easier in
	the manual we have adopted the following presentation to discuss shortcuts:

	in Linux and Windows menus or as

        <keycap>o</keycap>
      </keycombo>
	  
	in this manual.</para>
	<para>
	  We chose this description method so that <keycap>C</keycap> always mean
	  the <keycap>Control</keycap> key for Linux and Windows users and the
	  <keycap>Command</keycap> (or <keycap>⌘</keycap>) key for macOS users.
	  
	</para>

	<para>The difference between macOS shortcuts and Linux/Windows shortcuts
	rests mostly on the use of <keycap>Command</keycap> (<keycap>⌘</keycap>) as
	the macOS equivalent to <keycap>Control</keycap> on Linux/Windows. In the
	few cases where macOS shortcuts do use the <keycap>Control</keycap> key, we
