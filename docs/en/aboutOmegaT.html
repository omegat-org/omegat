OmegaT is a free multi platform Computer Aided Translation tool, with
the following highlights:
</p>
<h3><a name="tm"></a>Translation
memory</h3>
<p>OmegaT memorizes your
translations in a translation memory. At the same time it can use
memories from previous translations for reference. Translation memories
can be very useful for a translation with a number of repetitions or
reasonably similar segments of text. OmegaT uses translation memories
to remember your previous translations and suggest to you the most
probable translations for the text you are working on.</p>
<p>The translation memories can be
very useful when a document, that's been already translated, needs to
be updated. Unchanged sentences will remain as translated, and updated
sentences will be shown with an older version of the same sentence as
the most probable translation. Modifications to the original document
will thus be handled with greater ease. If you are using previously
created translation memories, for example given to you by translation
agency or your client, OmegaT will be able to use them as a reference
memories.</p>
<p>OmegaT uses the standard TMX
file format to store and access translation memories, which guarantees
that you can exchange your translation material with other CAT
applications, supporting this file format.</p>
<h3><a name="glossary"></a>Terminology
management</h3>
<p>Terminology management is
important for translation consistency. OmegaT uses glossaries that
contain translations of single words or small phrases, a sort of
simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific domain. OmegaT displays
the translation of those words that happen to be present in the current
segment for your reference.</p>
<h3><a name="process"></a>Translation
process</h3>
<p>Imagine having to translate
anything from a single file to a folder that contains subfolders
with a number of files in a variety of formats. When you let OmegaT
know that you need to translate those files it will look for the
included files it supports according to the file filtering rules,
recognize the textual parts in them, split the biggest text groups
according to the segmentation rules and display the segments one by one
so that you can proceed with the translation. OmegaT will memorize your
translations and will propose you translation candidates for segments
similar to those recorded in memory. Once you want to see how the files
would look once translated, you can create the translated files open
them in the appropriate application and see what your translation looks
like.</p>
