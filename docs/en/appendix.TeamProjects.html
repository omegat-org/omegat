            <p>The collaborative translation offered by OmegaT is based on the
                   functionality of version or revision control, widely used by the software
                   community to maintain control of changes to the code of a program and
                   allow unimpeded collaboration within the development team. OmegaT supports
                   two of the popular version control systems (VCS for short), <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_top">Apache Subversion</a> (often
                   abbreviated SVN, after the command name svn) and <a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_top">Git</a>. The advantages of a VC system for
                   a team of translators can be summarized as follows:

            <p>There are two possibilities to run an SVN server: you can install SVN
                   on your own server or you can use a hosted service. When using an external
                   service you must be aware of the possible implications in terms of
                   confidentiality, since you are loading the original document on a server
                   outside of your direct control. Alternatively, to avoid this issue you can
                   set a private SVN server, for example if you already have an Apache server
                   that includes the software in question (e.g. VisualSVN).
            </p>
            <p>Once the SVN server is available, project managers must
                   locally install a SVN client, in order to manage the project contents on
                   their computers. For Windows we recommend <a class="ulink" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/" target="_top">TortoiseSVN</a>. For Mac you can
                   download the client for instance from <a class="ulink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/macsvn/" target="_top">SourceForge</a>, For
                   Linux see <a class="ulink" href="www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Subversion.html" target="_top">Subversion Commands and
                      Scripts</a>.

                        connect clients to the SVN server you have just established. This is
                        also the place to add members of the team to the project and assign them
                        their rights. Note that the team members have to be registered first,
                        before you can add them to the project (Note: in the free version of
                        ProjectLocker you are allowed only two users per project).

               <p>Projects can be managed according to your development style and
                        needs. Similar as in the case of OmegaT projects, you will need to have
                        separate repositories for different language pairs. Within a given
                        language pair it is best to keep different subjects and/or clients as
                        separate repositories as well. The alternative is to have one single
                        repository with subfolders <code class="literal">Project1</code>, <code class="literal">Project2</code>, etc.,
                        and share the common material via common <code class="literal">tm</code>, <code class="literal">glossary</code>
                        and <code class="literal">dictionary</code> folders.
               </p>
               <p>For the example shown here we decided for the one OmegaT project -
                        one single repository for the simplicity reasons. .

               <p>In the next step, we will add the OmegaT files to the local
                        directory. The following files are to be shared among the members of the
                        team and thus have to be included in any case:
               </p>

                        level. Avoid in any case adding <code class="filename">bak</code> files,

                        <code class="filename">project_stats_match.txt</code>, in the <code class="filename">omegat</code> subfolder, as
                        they would without any need or profit just bloat the repository. You might want to apply the same to

            <p>For subsequent use, all is needed is opening the project like any other
