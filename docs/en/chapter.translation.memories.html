                        <p>The /tm/ folder can contain any number of ancillary
                                       translation memories - i.e. tmx files. Such files can be created
                                       in any of the three varieties indicated above. Note that other CAT
                                       tools can export (and import as well) tmx files, usually in all
                                       three forms. The best thing of course is to use OmegaT-specific
                                       TMX files (see above), so that the in-line formatting within the
                                       segment is retained.
                        </p>
                        <p>The contents of translation memories in the tm subfolder
                                       serve to generate suggestions for the text(s) to be translated.
                                       Any text, already translated and stored in those files, will
                                       appear among the fuzzy matches, if it is sufficiently similar to
                                       the text currently being translated.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the source segment in one of the ancillary TMs is
                                       identical to the text being translated, OmegaT acts as defined in
                                       the <span class="guimenu">Options</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Editing Behavior...</span> dialog window. For instance (if the default is
                                       accepted), the translation from the ancillary TM is accepted and
                                       prefixed with<span class="emphasis"><em> [fuzzy]</em></span>, so that the translator
                                       can review the translations at a later stage and check whether the
                                       segments tagged this way, have been translated correctly (see the
                                       <a class="link" href="chapter.translation.editing.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Editing behavior">Editing

                        <p>It may happen, that translation memories, available in
                                       the <code class="filename">tm</code> subfolder, contain segments with
                                       identical source text, but differing targets. TMX files are read
                                       sorted by their names and segments within a given TMX file line by
                                       line. The last segment with the identical source text will thus
                                       prevail (Note: of course it makes more sense to avoid this to
                                       happen in the first place).
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that the TMX files in the tm folder can be compressed

                        <p>Sometimes, it is useful to distinguish between high-quality
                                       translation memories and those that are, because of the subject
                                       matter, client, revision status, etc., less reliable. For
                                       translation memories in folders with a name "penalty-xxx" (with
                                       xxx between 0 and 100), matches will be degraded according to the
                                       name of the folder: a 100% match in any of TMs, residing in a
                                       folder called Penalty-30 for instance, will be lowered to a 70%
                                       match. The penalty applies to all three match percentages: matches
                                       75, 80, 90 will in this case be lowered to 45, 50, 60.

                        <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code> is also saved/updated when the
                        project is closed or loaded again. This means for instance that you do
                        not need to exit a project you are currently working on if you decide to
                        add another ancillary TM to it: you simply reload the project, and the
                        changes you have made will be included.

               <p>The locations of the various different translation memories for a

               <p>Depending on the situation, different strategies are thus

               <p>Tmx files contain translation units, made of a number of
                        equivalent segments in several languages. A translation unit comprises
                        at least two translation unit variants (TUV). Either can be used as the
                        source or target.

               <p>The settings in your project indicate which is the source and

                        corresponding to the project's source and target language codes and uses
                        them as the source and target segments respectively. OmegaT recognizes
                        the language codes using the following two standard conventions :

               <p>If the project language codes and the tmx language codes fully
                        match, the segments are loaded in memory. If languages match but not the
                        country, the segments still get loaded. If neither the language code not
                        the country code match, the segments will be ignored.
               </p>
               <p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e6578"></a>TMX files can generally contain translation units with
                        several candidate languages. If for a given source segment there is no
                        entry for the selected target language, all other target segments are
                        loaded, regardless of the language. For instance, if the language pair
                        of the project is DE-FR, it can be still be of some help to see hits in
                        the DE-EN translation, if there's none in the DE-FR pair.

            <p>Initially, that is when the project is created, the main TM of the
                   project, <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code> is empty. This TM gradually
                   becomes filled during the translation. To speed up this process, existing
                   translations can be reused. If a given sentence has already been
                   translated once, and translated correctly, there is no need for it to be
                   retranslated. Translation memories may also contain reference
                   translations: multinational legislation, such as that of the European
                   Community, is a typical example.
            </p>
            <p>When you create the target documents in an
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project, the translation memory of the
                   project is output in the form of three files in the root folder of your
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project (see the above description). You
                   can regard these three tmx files (<code class="filename">-omegat.tmx</code>,
                   <code class="filename">-level1.tmx</code> and <code class="filename">-level2.tmx</code>) as
                   an "export translation memory", i.e. as an export of your current
                   project's content in bilingual form.
            </p>
            <p>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous
                   project (for example because the new project is similar to the previous
                   project, or uses terminology which might have been used before), you can
                   use these translation memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for
                   import into your new project. In this case, place the translation memories
                   you wish to use in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/tm</em></span> or
                   <span class="emphasis"><em>/tm</em></span>/auto folder of your new project: in the former
                   case you will get hits from these translation memories in the fuzzy
                   matches viewer, and in the latter case these TMs will be used to
                   pre-translate your source text.
            </p>
            <p>By default, the /tm folder is below the project's root folder (e.g.
                   ...<span class="emphasis"><em>/MyProject/tm</em></span>), but you can choose a different
                   folder in the project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you
                   frequently use translation memories produced in the past, for example
                   because they are on the same subject or for the same customer. In this
                   case, a useful procedure would be:

                        to be read by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not fully support imported
                        level 2 tmx files (these store not only the translation, but also the
                        formatting). Level 2 tmx files will still be imported and their textual
                        content can be seen in OmegaT, but the quality of fuzzy matches will be
                        somewhat lower.

               <p>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when loading translation
                        memory (tmx) files. If an error is found in such a file, OmegaT will
                        indicate the position within the defective file at which the error is

                        conditions. If you wish to use such files as reference translations in
                        OmegaT, they must be repaired, or OmegaT will report an error and fail
                        to load them. Fixes are trivial operations and OmegaT assists
                        troubleshooting with the related error message. You can ask the user
                        group for advice if you have problems.
               </p>
               <p>OmegaT exports version 1.4 TMX files (both level 1 and level 2).
                        The level 2 export is not fully compliant with the level 2 standard, but
                        is sufficiently close and will generate correct matches in other
                        translation memory tools supporting TMX Level 2. If you only need
                        textual information (and not formatting information), use the level 1
                        file that OmegaT has created.

               <p>There may be cases where you have done a project with e.g. Dutch
                        sources, and a translation in say English. Then you need a translation
                        in e.g. Chinese, but your translator does not understand Dutch; she,
                        however, understands perfectly English. In this case NL-EN translation
                        memory can serve as a go-between to help generate NL-ZH
                        translation.
               </p>
               <p>The solution in our example is to copy the existing translation
                        memory into the tm subfolder and rename it ZH_CN.tmx to indicate the
                        target language of the tmx. The translator will be shown English
                        translations for source segments in Dutch and use them to create the
                        Chinese translation.
               </p>
               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Important: </strong></span>the supporting TMX
                        must be renamed XX_YY.tmx, where XX_YY is the target language of the
                        tmx, for instance to ZH_CN.tmx in the example above. The project and TMX
                        source languages should of course be identical - NL in our example. Note
                        that only one TMX for a given language pair is possible, so if several
                        translation memories should be involved, you will need to merge them all
                        into the XX_YY.tmx.

            <p>Some types of source files (for instance PO, TTX, etc.) are
                   bilingual, i.e. they serve both as a source and as a translation memory.
                   In such cases, an existing translation, found in the file, is included in
                   the <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code>. It is treated as a default
                   translation, if no match has been found, or as an alternative translation,
                   in case the same source segment exists, but with a target text. The result
                   will thus depend on the order in which the source segments have been
                   loaded.

            <p>All translations from source documents are also displayed in the
                   Comment pane, in addition to the Match pane. In case of PO files, a 20%
                   penalty applied to the alternative translation (i.e., a 100% match becomes
                   an 80% match). The word [Fuzzy] is displayed on the source segment.
            </p>
            <p>When you load a segmented TTX file, segments with source = target
                   will be included, if "Allow translation to be equal to source" in Options
                   → Editing Behavior... has been checked. This may be confusing, so you may
                   consider unchecking this option in this case.

            <p>Before segments get translated, you may wish to pre-process them or

                   if you wish to create a pseudo-translation for testing purposes, OmegaT
                   enables you to create an additional tmx file that contains all segments of
