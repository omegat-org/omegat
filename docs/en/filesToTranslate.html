  <h3><a name="#RTLbidi"></a>Right to left languages</h3>

  <h4><a name="#RTL_Changing_direction"></a>Changing the direction of the
  input/display text</h4>For all the tasks accomplished in OmegaT, you can
  toggle between LTR display/input mode and RTL display/input mode by pressing
  Ctrl+Shift+O (this is the letter O and not the numeral 0). Using the RTL mode
  in OmegaT has no influence whatsoever on the display mode of the translated
  document that are created in OmegaT. The display mode of the translated
  documents will have to be modified within the application commonly used to
  display or modify them (check the relevant manuals for details). Using
  Ctrl+Shift+O causes both text input and display in OmegaT to be changed to
  RTL. It can be used separately for all three panes (Editor, Fuzzy Matches and
  Glossary) by clicking on the pane and toggling the display mode. It can also
  be used in all the input fields found in OmegaT (search window, segmentation
  rules etc.)

  <p>Note: Mac OSX uses the same shortcut (and not Cmd+Shift+O) .</p>

  <h4><a name="#RTL_mixing"></a>Mixing RTL and LTR strings in segments</h4>When
  writing purely RTL text, the default (LTR) view may be used. In many cases,
  however, it is necessary to embed LTR text in RTL text. For example, in
  OmegaT tags, product names that have to remain in the LTR source language,
  place holders in localization files, and numbers in text. In cases like these
  it becomes necessary to switch to RTL mode, so that the RTL (in fact
  bidirectional) text is displayed correctly. It should be noted that when
  OmegaT is in RTL mode, both source and target are displayed in RTL mode. This
  means that if the source language is LTR and the target language is RTL, or
  vice versa, it might be necessary to toggle back and forth between RTL and
  LTR modes to easily view the source and enter the target in their respective
  modes.

  <h4><a name="#RTL_tags"></a>OmegaT tags in RTL segments</h4>

  <p>As written above, OmegaT tags are LTR strings. When translating between
  RTL and LTR langauges, to correctly read the tags from the source and to
  enter them properly in the target may require the translator to toggle
  between LTR and RTL modes numerous times.</p>

  <p>If the document allows, the translator is strongly encouraged to remove
  style information from the original document so that as few tags as possible
  appear in the OmegaT interface. Follow the indications given in Hints for
  tags management. Frequently validate tags (see <a href=
  "userInterface.html#tag_validation">Tag validation)</a> and produce
  translated documents (see below and <a href="menu.html">Menu</a>) at regular
  intervals to make it easier to catch any problems that arise. It should be
  possible to translate a plain text version of the text and to later add the
  necessary style in the relevant application.</p>

  <h4><a name="RTL_CreatingTranslatedDocuments" id=
  "RTL_CreatingTranslatedDocuments"></a>Creating translated RTL documents</h4>

  <p>When the translated document is created, its display direction will be the
  same as the original document. If the original document was LTR, the display
  direction of the target document must be changed manually to RTL in its
  viewing application. Each output format has specific ways to deal with RTL
  display, check the relevant application manuals for details.</p>

  <p>To avoid changing the target files display parameters each time the files
  are opened, it is sometimes possible to change the source file display
  parameters so that such parameters are inherited by the target files. Such
  modifications are possible in OpenOffice.org files for example.</p>

  <h3><a name="formats" id="formats"></a>File formats</h3>

  <p>With OmegaT you can translate files in a number of file formats. There are
  basically two types of file formats, the <strong>plain text</strong> and the
  <strong>formatted text</strong> formats.</p>

  <h3><a name="plaintext" id="plaintext"></a>Plain text files</h3>

  <p>Plain text files contain text only, so their translation is as simple as
  typing the translation.</p>

  <p>There are several <a href="plainText.html">methods</a> to specify the
  file's encoding so that its contents is not garbled when opened in
  OmegaT.</p>

  <p>Such files are not considered as containing more format than "white space"
  for indentation/alignment purposes. They are usually modified in text editors
  and it is generally not possible to have such format retain font/color/margin
  etc information.</p>

  <p>Currently, OmegaT supports the following plain text formats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>ASCII text (.txt, etc.)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Encoded text</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Java resource bundles (.properties)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>PO files (.po)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>INI (key=value) files (.ini)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other plain text file types can be handled by OmegaT by <a href=
  "fileFilters.html">associating</a> their file extension to a supported file
  type (for example, <code>.pod</code> files could be associated to the ASCII
  text filter) and by pre-processing them with specific <a href=
  "segmentation.html">segmentation</a> rules.</p>

  <h3><a name="tagged" id="tagged"></a>Formatted text files</h3>

  <p>Formatted text files contain text as well as information such as font
  type, size, color etc. They are commonly created in word processors or home
  page editors. Such file formats are conceived so that they retain formatting
  information. Such formatting information can be as simple as <strong>this is
  bold</strong> or as complex as table data with different font size, color,
  position etc. In most translation jobs it is considered important to have the
  translated document look similar to the original. OmegaT allows you to do
  this by marking the characters/words that have a special formatting with easy
  to manipulate <a href="formattedText.html">tags</a>. Simplifying the original
  text formatting greatly contributes to reducing the number of tags. Unifying
  used fonts, font sizes, colors etc should be considered if possible, to
  simplify the translation and reduce the number of possible <a href=
  "userInterface.html#tag_validation">tag errors</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="specifics" id="specifics"></a>Each file type is handled
  differently in OmegaT. Specific behavior can be setup in the <a href=
  "fileFilters.html">file filters</a>. Currently, OmegaT support the following
  formatted text formats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>OpenOffice.org</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>OpenDocument</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Microsoft Open XML</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>(X)HTML</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>HTML Help Compiler</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>DocBook</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Okapi monolingual XLIFF</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other formatted text file types can be handled by OmegaT by <a href=
  "fileFilters.html">associating</a> their file extension to a supported file
  type and by pre-processing them with specific <a href=
  "segmentation.html">segmentation</a> rules.</p>

  <h3><a name="others" id="others">Other file formats</h3>

  <p>Other plain text or formatted text file formats may also be processed in
  OmegaT.</p>

  <p>External tools can be used to convert files to supported formats. Please
  remember, that the translated files will need to be converted back to the
  original format. This way, a number of plain text formats (including LaTex
  etc) can be translated in OmegaT through conversion to the PO format.
  Similarly, a number of formatted text formats (including Microsoft Office
  files) can be translated in OmegaT through conversion to the Open Document
  format.</p>

  <p>The quality of the translated file will depend on the quality of the
  round-trip conversion. Make sure you have tested all your options before
  proceeding with such conversions. Available free conversion tools
  include:</p>
