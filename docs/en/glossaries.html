<p>Glossaries are files that are
created and updated manually for
use in OmegaT.</p>
<p>If an OmegaT project contains
one or more glossaries, any
terms in the glossary which are also found in the active segment will
be automatically displayed in the <a href="userInterface.html#Glossary">Glossary
viewer</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="usage" id="usage"></a>Usage</h2>
<p>To use an existing glossary,
simply place it in the <span style="font-style: italic;">/glossary</span>
folder after creating the project. OmegaT automatically detects
glossary files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the
active segment which OmegaT finds in the glossary file(s) are displayed
in the Glossary pane:</p>
<p><img src="images/Glossary_pane.png" name="graphics1"
 alt="Glossary pane" id="graphics1"
 style="border: 0px"><br>
</p>
<br>
The word before the = sign is the source term, and its translation is
(or are) the words behind =. The vocabulary entry can have a comment
added (see "transitive verb" for the second item). The
glossary function only
finds exact matches with the
glossary entry (e.g. does not find inflected forms etc.). New
terms can
be added
manually to the glossary file(s) during translation (for example in a
text editor), but newly added terms will not be recognized until the
project is reloaded.
<hr>
<h2><a name="fileformat" id="fileformat"></a>File
format</h2>
<p>Glossary files are simply plain
text files containing
three-column, tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in
the first and second columns respectively. The third column can be used
for additional information. Glossary files can be either in
system default encoding (and indicated by the extension <code>.tab</code>)
or in UTF-8 (the extension <code>.utf8</code>).
The Unicode encoding (UTF8) is to be preferred for obvious
reasons.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="howtocreate" id="howtocreate"></a>How
to create glossaries</h2>
The method here is foolproof, when followed in a reasonably careful
fashion. You
need OpenOffice.org Writer for it, so - if you haven't already done so
- download and install OpenOffice.org. Launch
OpenOffice.org and open a new text document or launch "OpenOffice.org
Writer".<br>
<br>
In the empty document, enter your glossary terms as follows:
a source-language term, tabspace, the
target-language term , tabspace, a comment or explanation for the item,
and a&nbsp;Return. Tabspace is the tabulator key on the lefthand
side of the keyboard. If you do not want to add any comments, you can
drop the second tabspace. A "term" can be a single word or a whole
phrase. On the second line, enter the second term and its translation.<br>
<br>
When you have finished entering the terms, you will have two "columns"
of terms, source-language terms on the left and their target-language
terms on the right, and possibly a third column, containing you
comments and explanations, The tabspace (&rarr;
in the example below)&nbsp;
and Enter (&para;&nbsp;) characters can be made visible by
clicking on the&nbsp; &para; icon&nbsp; in the
Writer's Standard
writer bar. Here's a few lines of an&nbsp;English
-German
glossary:<br>
<br>
<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
word &rarr;Wort&rarr;das (-/e/s, W&ouml;rter/-e)&para;</div>
<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
small house&rarr;H&auml;uschen&rarr;das,
(pl&nbsp;H&auml;uschen)&para;</div>
<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dog &rarr;Hund&rarr;m, f H&uuml;ndin&nbsp;&para;</div>
<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
horse&rarr;Pferd&rarr;n, m Hengst f Stute n Fohlen&para;</div>
<br>
Do NOT use OpenOffice.org's "columns"
function to create columns:&nbsp; just separate each source and
target-language term pair with a single
tabspace.<br>
<br>
When you are finished with the entries,&nbsp;Select <span
 style="font-style: italic;">File &gt;
Save As</span>.
In the "File location" box, enter a name for your glossary file,
followed by the extension "<span style="font-weight: bold;">.utf8</span>"
(e.g.
"<span style="font-style: italic;">MyGlossary.utf8</span>").&nbsp;For
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Filter</span>",
select "<span style="font-style: italic;">Text
Encoded (.txt.)</span>".&nbsp;
Uncheck the
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Automatic
file name extension</span>" box and
activate "<span style="font-style: italic;">Edit
filter settings</span>":<br>
<br>
<img alt="save file as dialog for the glossary"
 src="images/saveglossary.png"><br>
<br>
Confirm with OK. A dialog box appears with two options:&nbsp; "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Yes</span>"
and&nbsp;
"<span style="font-style: italic;">No</span>".
Select "<span style="font-style: italic;">Yes</span>"
to save in
text encoded file format. <br>
<br>
In the ASCII Filter Options dialog
(see below),
select "<span style="font-style: italic;">Unicode
(UTF-8)</span>" as the character set:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 510px; height: 158px;"
 alt="ascii file filter options for glossary"
 src="./images/AsciiFilteroptions.png"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;Confirm with OK.<br>
<br>
 After creating an OmegaT project, copy or move this file into the
 project's <span style="font-style: italic;">\glossary</span>
 folder. If the project is already open, reload it
 after copying the glossary file. You can make changes to a
 glossary file whilst it is being used in project. Glossary changes
 are being detected approximately once every second and modifications
 loaded transparently in the background, so there's no need to reload
 the project after saving the new glossary file.<br> 
<br>
 When a segment containing a source-text term is opened, the
 glossary pane will display glossary entries for those items in the
 source segment that can be found in the glossary (or glossaries - you
 can have more than one available, and they can be stored in subfolders of <i>glossary</i> as well).
<h3><a name="multiterm" id="multiterm"></a>Using
Trados Multiterm</h3>
<p>Glossaries created using Trados
Multiterm's text export
function for example can be used as OmegaT glossaries without further
modification, provided they are given the file extension <code>.tab</code>
and the source and target term fields are the first two fields
respectively. If you export using the system option "Tab-delimited
export", you will need to delete the first 5 columns (Seq. Nr, Date
created etc) before the two items of interest.</p>
