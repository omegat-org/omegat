  <h2>Default encoding</h2>

  <p>Plain text files - in most of the cases with a <code>.txt</code>
  extension - contain exclusively textual information. There is no clearly
  defined way to inform the computer which language they contain. In (very)
  simple terms, that means the computer will per default assume the text is
  written in the same language the computer itself uses.</p>

  <h2>Garbled displays</h2>

  <p>If you are Russian, it is very likely that your computer works in Russian
  too: the menus are in Russian, the files you open will be in Russian etc. In
  most cases, the computer makes the right assumption regarding the Contents of
  files in general: they all contain Russian and nothing Russian characters
  could not display.</p>

  <p>Now, if you are a Russian translator who translates from Japanese, the
  Japanese files you will get, if they are <strong>plain text</strong> files,
  will most probably be considered by the computer to be files containing
  Russian. Because there is no information in the file itself that indicates to
  the computer in which language they are written. The Japanese file contents
  could be:</p>

  <p>OmegaTとは、コンピュータを利用した翻訳ツールです。</p><br>

  <p>Because it expects the contents to be Russian, your text editor could very
  well display it like this:</p>

  <p>OmegaTВ∆ВЌБAГRГУГsГЕБ[Г^ВрЧШЧpВµВљЦ|ЦуГcБ[ГЛВ≈ВЈБB</p><br>

  <p>However, it is far from Russian, it is Japanese characters wrongly
  displayed as Russian characters.</p>

  <p>As any other application, OmegaT is subject to this problem too. It can
  only assume that per default <strong>plain text</strong> files can be
  displayed using the system defaults. That works well when the computer works
  in French for instance and the files are in English, or when the computer is
  German and you deal with get Italian files.</p>

  <h2>Character sets and encoding</h2>

  <p>Why would that work with English and French but not with Russian and
  Japanese? Because English and French share a common <strong>character
  set</strong>. Namely <strong>Latin-1</strong>, or some variation of it. Until
  recently, Russian and Japanese have not shared any character sets. Most
  current Russian characters sets do not cover Japanese and vice versa. The
  result is what you have seen above.</p>

  <p>The Japanese client works with a Japanese computer and creates text files
  that contain Japanese. The character set selected by the client computer will
  depend on the operating system and on other settings, but it is highly
  unlikely that the chosen (Japanese) character set will be correctly
  interpreted by the Russian computer.</p>

  <p>How the textual information in the specified character set is physically
  transmitted (i.e. what are the numeric codes the computer uses to interpret
  and display text) depends on the <strong>encoding</strong>. When the computer
  reads the file, it "decodes" the information according to the encoding and
  displays it according to the character set. Roughly speaking, one encoding
  corresponds to one character set...</p>

  <h2>The OmegaT solution</h2>

  <p>There are basically three ways to address this problem in OmegaT. They all
  involve the application of <a href="fileFilters.html">file filters</a> in the
  <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Specify the encoding for your <strong>plain text</strong> files - i.e.
    files with <code>.txt</code> extension - :&nbsp;in the <strong>Text
    files</strong> section of the <a href="fileFilters.html">file filters</a>
    dialog, change the <strong>Source File Encoding</strong> from
    <strong>&lt;auto&gt;</strong> to the encoding that corresponds to your
    source <code>.txt</code> file.</li>

    <li>Change the extensions of your plain text source files (from
    <code>.txt</code> to <code>.jp</code> for Japanese plain texts for
    instance):&nbsp;In the <strong>Text files</strong> section of the <a href=
    "fileFilters.html">file filters</a> dialog, add a new <strong>Source
    Filename Pattern</strong> (for example <code>*.jp)&nbsp;</code>and select
    the appropriate parameters for the source and target encoding.</li>

    <li>Change the encoding of your files to Unicode:&nbsp;open your source
    file in a text editor that correctly interprets its encoding and save the
    file in the "UTF-8" encoding. Change the file extension from
    <code>.txt</code> to <code>.utf8</code>.OmegaT will automatically interpret
    the file as a UTF-8 file.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>OmegaT has by default the following short list available to make it easier
  for you to deal with some plain text files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>.txt</code> files are automatically
    (<strong>&lt;auto&gt;</strong>) interpreted by OmegaT as being encoded in
    the computer's default encoding.</li>

    <li><code>.txt1</code> files are files in ISO-8859-1, covering most
    <strong>Western Europe</strong> languages.</li>

    <li><code>.txt2</code> files are files in ISO-8859-2, that covers most
    <strong>Central and Eastern Europe</strong> languages</li>

    <li><code>.utf8</code> files are interpreted by OmegaT as being encoded in
    UTF-8 (an encoding that covers almost <strong>all</strong> languages in the
    world).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can check that yourself by selecting the item <strong>File
  Filters</strong> in the menu <strong>Options</strong>. For example, when you
  have a Czech text file (very probably written in the
  <strong>ISO-8859-2</strong> code) you just need to change the extension
  <code>.txt</code> to <code>.txt2</code> and OmegaT will interpret its
  contents correctly. And of course, if you want to be on the safe side,
  consider converting this kind of files to Unicode, i.e. to the .utf8 file
  format.</p>
