  <h3><a name="calling" id="calling"></a>Calling up a search</h3>

  <p>OmegaT provides a powerful range of search functions. Call up the
  <strong>Search</strong> window with <code>Ctrl+F</code> and enter the word or
  phrase you wish to search for in the <strong>Search for</strong> box.
  Alternatively, in the Editor window, select a word or phrase in the editing
  field (target text of the active segment) and hit <code>Ctrl+F</code>. The
  word or phrase is entered in the <strong>Search for</strong> box
  automatically in this case.Every call of the <strong>Search</strong> window
  creates its own new window. Do not forget to close them, so that they do not 
  clutter your desktop.</p>

  <h3><a name="location" id="location"></a>Search location</h3>

  <p>Searches occur both in the source as well as in the target section of the
  project. You may search in</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the project only (default setting)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>the project as well as in the reference translation memories in /tm/
      (check <i>Search TMs</i>)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>a single file or a folder containing a set of files (check <i>Search
      files</i>)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>when searching through files, OmegaT will restrict the search to files in source file formats (See <a href="filesToTranslate.html">Supported File
  Formats</a>). For instance, while OmegaT is well able to handle TMX files, it will not include them in the search.</p>

  <h2><a name="searchmethods" id="searchmethods"></a>Search methods</h2>

  <p>Select the method using the radio buttons. You can choose between two
  methods to search:</p>

  <table summary= "just formatting" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="20%">
    <col width="80%">

    <tr>
      <td width="20%">
        <p><strong>exact search</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td width="80%">
        <p>Search for segments containing of the string you specified.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="20%">
        <p><strong>keyword search</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td width="80%">
        <p>Search for segments containing all keywords you specified, in any
        order.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>An <strong>exact search</strong> looks for a phrase, i.e. if several words
  are entered, they are found only if they occur in exactly the same sequence.
  Exact searches are similar to an "exact phrase" search in an Internet search
  engine such as Google. Select <strong>keyword search</strong> to search for
  any number of individual words, separated by spaces and in any order. OmegaT
  will display a list of all segments in which all the words occur. Keyword 
  searches are similar to a search "with all of the words" in an Internet search 
  engine such as Google (AND logic).</p>

  <p>For either of these two methods you can select the following three
  options:</p>

  <table summary= "just formatting" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
    <col width="20%">
    <col width="80%">

    <tr>
      <td width="20%">
        <p><strong>case sensitive</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td width="80%">
        <p>The search will be performed for the exact string specified;
        otherwise capitals will be ignored.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="20%">
        <p><strong>regular expressions</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td width="80%">
        <p>The search string will be treated as a regular expression (in case
        of a keyword search it will be treated as multiple expressions).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td width="20%">
        <p><strong>search TMs</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td width="80%">
        <p>All translation memories are included in the search.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="usingwildcards" id="usingwildcards"></a>Using wild cards</h2>

  <p>In both exact and keyword searches, the wild card search characters
  '<code>*</code>' and '<code>?</code>' can be used. To use wild cards, make
  sure the option <strong>regular expressions</strong> is not selected,
  otherwise these characters are interpreted as special regular expression
  characters.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>'<strong>*</strong>' matches zero or more characters. The search term
      '<strong>run*</strong>' for example would match '<strong>run</strong>',
      '<strong>runs</strong>', and '<strong>running</strong>'.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>'<strong>?</strong>' matches any single character. For instance,
      '<strong>run?</strong>' would match '<strong>runs</strong>' and
      '<strong>rung</strong>', but not '<strong>run</strong>' or
      '<strong>running</strong>'.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you wish to search for segments containing either <strong>*</strong> or
  <strong>?</strong>, you will need to switch on regular expressions, and
  escape these characters by prefixing a backslash ('\') to them, i.e. 'x\*y'
  to find instances of 'x*y' and 'x\?<code>y</code>' to find instances of
  '<code>x?y</code>'.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="usingregularexpressions" id="usingregularexpressions"></a>Using
  regular expressions</h2>

  <p>A regular expression search is a powerful way to look for instances of a
  string. It is similar to a wild card search, but allows far more flexibility.
  The regular expressions used in searches are those supported by Java. A short
  summary is available in the <a href="regexp.html">Regular Expressions
  Constructs</a> appendix. If you need more specific information, please
  consult <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html</a>.</p>

  <p>You can find simple tutorials on the web (<a href=
  "http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html">http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html</a>,
  for example.)</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="display" id="display"></a>Search results display</h2>

  <p>Pressing the search button after entering a string in the search field
  will display all the segments in the project that include the searched
  string. As OmegaT handles identical segments as one single entity, only the
  first unique segment is shown.</p>

  <p>The segments are displayed in order of appearance in the project.
  Translated segments will be displayed with the original text at the top and
  the translated text at the bottom, untranslated segments will be displayed
  as the source only.</p>

  <p>Clicking on a segment will open it in the Editor for modifications. You may
  then switch back to Search window for the next found segment, for instance to
  control and if necessary correct the terminology.</p>
