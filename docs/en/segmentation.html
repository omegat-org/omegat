  <p>Translation memory tools work with textual units called segments. OmegaT
  has 2 ways to segment a text: paragraph segmentation and sentence
  segmentation. In order to select the type of segmentation, select
  <strong>Project → Properties...</strong> from the main menu and use the
  available check box. Note that paragraph segmentation is pretty much outdated
  and that for the majority of projects the sentence segmentation is a choice
  to be preferred. If sentence segmentation has been selected, you can setup
  the rules by selecting <strong>Options → Segmentation...</strong> from the
  main menu.</p>

  <p>Note that a good part of the development has been spent in developing
  dependable segmentation rules, so in a majority of cases you will not need to
  get involved with writing your own segmentation rules. On the other hand this
  functionality can be very useful in special cases, allowing you to translate
  what needs to be translated without running the danger of changing, what
  needs to stay unchanged.</p>

  <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Changing the filters options while the project
  is open, may result in the loss of data. If you change segmentation options
  when a project is open, you will have to reload the project for the changes
  to take effect.</p>

  <h2><a name="structure" id="structure"></a>Structure level segmentation</h2>

  <p>OmegaT first parses the text for structure-level segmentation. During this
  process it is only the structure of the source file that is used to produce
  segments.</p>

  <p>For example, <a href="fileFilters.html#filter_options">text files</a> may
  be segmented on line breaks, empty lines, or not be segmented at all. Files
  with formatting (OpenOffice.org documents, HTML documents, etc.) are
  segmented on block-level (paragraph) tags. Translatable object <a href=
  "fileFilters.html#filter_options">attributes</a> in XHTML or HTML files can
  be extracted as separate segments.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="sentence" id="sentence"></a>Sentence level segmentation</h2>

  <p>After segmenting the source file into logical units, OmegaT will further
  segment these blocks into sentences.</p>

  <h3><a name="about" id="about"></a>Segmentation rules</h3>

  <p>The process of segmenting can be pictured as follows: imagine the cursor
  move along the text, one character at a time. For each cursor position each
  rule is applied in the given order to see if the <strong>Before</strong>
  pattern applies the text on the left and the <strong>After</strong> pattern
  to the text on the right of the cursor. If the rule matches, the program
  stops the rules examination (´for the exception rule) or creates a new
  segment (for the break rule).</p>

  <p>The Sentence Segmentation has been implemented with the help of the
  <a href="http://www.lisa.org/standards/srx/">Segmentation Rules eXchange
  (SRX)</a> standard - please note that not all SRX features are supported. And
  it is not possible to import/export rules defined in SRX format. However, if
  you know how SRX works, you will already know a lot about how OmegaT does the
  segmentation.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Break rules</strong> separate the source text into segments.
      For example, <i>"Did it make sense? I was not sure."</i> should be
      separated in two segments means, there should be a break rule for
      "<code>?</code>".</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Exception rules</strong> specify what parts of text should NOT
      be separated. In spite of the period, <i>"Mrs. Dalloway "</i> should not
      be separated in two segments, so an exception rule should be established
      for Mrs (and Mr and Dr and prof etc), followed by a period.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The predefined break rules should be sufficient for most European
  languages and Japanese. Given the flexibility you may consider defining more
  exception rules for the language you translate from, to give you more
  meaningful and coherent segments.</p>

  <h3><a name="setup" id="setup"></a>Rules setup</h3>

  <h3><a name="priority" id="priority"></a>Priority</h3>

  <p>All the segmentation rule sets with a matching Language Pattern are
  applied in the given order of priority, so rules for specific language should
  be higher than default ones. For example, rules for Canadian French (FR-CA)
  should be higher than rules for French (FR.*), and higher than Default (.*)
  ones. Then while translating from Canadian French your project will use the
  rules defined for this language, the rules for French, and the Default rules
  in a correct order.</p>

  <h3><a name="creation" id="creation"></a>Rules creation</h3>

  <p>In order to edit or expand an existing set of rules, simply click on it in
  the top table. The rules of the set will appear in the bottom half of the
  window.</p>

  <p>In order to create an empty set of rules for a new language pattern click
  <strong>Add</strong> in the upper half of the dialog. An empty line will
  appear at the bottom of the upper table <font color="black" face=
  "Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: black;" lang=
  "EN-US">(you may have to scroll down to see it)</span></font>. Change the
  name of the rule set and the language pattern. Syntax of the language pattern
  conforms to <a href="regexp.html">regular expression</a> syntax. If your set
  of rules handles a language-country pair, we advise you to move it to the top
  using <strong>Move Up</strong> button.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3><a name="break" id="break"></a>Break/Exception</h3>

  <p>The Break/Exception check box determines whether it is a break rule (check
  box set) or an exception rule (check box unset). Two regular expressions
  Before and After specify what must be before and after some position so that
  it qualifies for exception rule or for break rule.</p>
