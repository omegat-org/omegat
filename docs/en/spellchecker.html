  <h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a> Introduction</h3>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>To correct the spelling mistakes during the translation, the spell checker
  can be installed and used to indicate words in the target text, that need to
  be corrected. This should come as no surprise: OmegaT uses the <a href=
  "http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/">Hunspell</a> spell checker, used among
  others in OpenOffice.org, Firefox and Thunderbird. If you use any of these
  programs, you may already have the essentials of the spell checker installed
  and just need to get OmegaT connected.</p>

  <p>Once the spell checker has been activated and the vocabulary for the
  target language is available, the spell checker will monitor target segments,
  that are being displayed in the editing pane. Questionable words get
  underlined in wiggly red:</p>

  "Spell checking the text" align="left" width="535" height="302" border="0"
  id="grafika1"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Right clicking on a highlighted word (<i>Artund</i> above) opens a
  drop-down menu, where the suggestions for the correction are listed (<i>Art
  und</i>) . Additionally you can ask the spell checker to <b>ignore all</b>
  the occurrences of the word or <b>add it to the dictionary</b>. Note that
  this is an online spell checker: if you have to do a global spell check of
  texts you will have to browse through the text yourself and watch for wiggly
  lines. The alternative is to spell check the target files with an editor, in
  other words outside of OmegaT so the changes you may make will not be in the
  translation memory.</p>

  <h3><a name="edit_dialog" id="edit_dialog"></a>Spell checker options</h3>

  <p>Clicking on <b>Options &gt; Spell checking...</b> will open the window
  below:</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The above example contains already the available vocabularies. Initially
  it will be unpopulated as you need to specify where OmegaT should look for
  the vocabularies. Click on <strong>Choose...</strong> to open a dialog
  window, where you can select a subfolder with existing OpenOffice.org or
  Mozilla vocabularies. The simplest way find them is to look for files with an
  extensions <i>aff</i> or <i>dic</i>. OmegaT will recognize all valid
  dictionaries available at that location and display them. If the dictionary
  you want to use is already there and visible to OmegaT, you're done. If
  there's no dictionaries to be found, you can select an appropriate place for
  them and then click <b>Install</b> to let OmegaT look for available
  vocabularies. Select the vocabularies that you need in the pop-up window and
  then click <b>install</b>. The selected languages will then get installed and
  will eventually appear in the spell checker setup window (this may take a
  while ).</p>

  <p>Please note that the installer depends on the Internet list of
  dictionaries. In case it is out of date or does not include the desired
  language, you will have to hunt for the vocabularies yourself. The
  OpenOffice.org contains probably the largest vocabulary collection at
  <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary">OpenOffice.org
  Dictionary site</a>. After the dictionary extension has been downloaded and
  installed, the corresponding <i>aff</i> and <i>dic</i> will become available.
  The same can be achieved by adding a spellchecker extension to the Firefox or
  Thunderbird; in this case the spellchecker files will be stored in your
  (Firefox or Thunderbird) profile.</p>

  <p>Make sure the language code of target files corresponds to the
  dictionary's language code: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR
  target setting. You need to change the setting to FR-FR to have the spell
  checker recognize the correct dictionary for your target. Look for files with
  the name, indicating the language used and having extensions <i>aff</i> and
  <i>dic.</i></p>

  <h3><a name="Hints" id="Hints"></a>Hints</h3>

  <p>Possible reasons for the spell checker not working:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The check box "Automatically check the spelling of text" must be
      checked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Check that the target language code of your project against the
      available vocabularies in the setup window. The spell checker determines
      the language to use from the target language code: if the target language
      is Brazilian Portuguese (PT_BR), the subfolder with vocabularies must
      contain the two vocabulary files, called <i>pt_br.aff</i> and
      <i>pt_br.dic</i>.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In case you have a large body of text already translated, but then realize
  the target language code of the project does not match the spell checker's
  language code (you specified pt_BR as the language, but there's no pt_BR
  vocabularies, for instance) you can simply copy the two corresponding files
  and rename them (from pt_PT.arr resp. pt_PT.dic to pt._BR.arr and pt_BR.dic).
  Of course it is much wiser, to take a short break and download the correct
  versions of the spellchecker.</p>

  <p>Note that Uninstall physically deletes the highlighted vocabularies. If
  they are part of OpenOffice as in the above case, they will disappear from
  that application too. If for whatever reason you have to do that now and
  again, it may make sense to copy the files involved to a different folder,
  reserved just for OmegaT purposes.</p>
