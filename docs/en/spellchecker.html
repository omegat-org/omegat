  <h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a> Introduction</h3>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>To correct the spelling mistakes during the translation, the spell checker
  can be installed and used to indicate words in the target text, that need to
  be corrected. This should come as no surprise: OmegaT uses the <a href=
  "http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/">Hunspell</a> spell checker, used among
  others in OpenOffice.org, Firefox and Thunderbird. If you use any of these
  programs, you may already have the essentials of the spell checker installed
  and just need to get OmegaT connected.</p>

  <p>Once the spell checker has been activated and the vocabulary for the
  target language is available, the spell checker will monitor target segments,
  that are being displayed in the editing pane. Questionable words get
  underlined in wiggly red:</p>

  "Spell checking the text" align="left" width="535" height="302" border="0"
  id="grafika1"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Right clicking on a highlighted word (<i>Artund</i> above) opens a
  drop-down menu, where the suggestions for the correction are listed (<i>Art
  und</i>) . Additionally you can ask the spell checker to <b>ignore all</b>
  the occurrences of the word or <b>add it to the dictionary</b>. Note that
  this is an online spell checker: if you have to do a global spell check of
  texts you will have to browse through the text yourself and watch for wiggly
  lines. The alternative is to spell check the target files with an editor, in
  other words outside of OmegaT so the changes you may make will not be in the
  translation memory.</p>

  <h3><a name="edit_dialog" id="edit_dialog"></a>Spell checker options</h3>

  <p>Clicking on <b>Options &gt; Spell checking...</b> will open the window
  below:</p>

  <p><br></p><img src="images/SpellcheckerSetup2.png" name="grafika2" alt=
  "Spel checker setup" align="left" width="498" height="325" border="0" id=
  "grafika2"><br clear="left">

  <p><br></p>

  <p>The above example contains already the available vocabularies. Initially
  it will be unpopulated as you need to specify where OmegaT should look for
  the vocabularies. Clicking on <strong>Choose...</strong> opens a dialog
  window, where you can select the correct subfolder - the <b>Dictionary file
  directory</b> - which is <i>C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org
  2.4\share\dict\ooo</i> in the above example. This is of course the directory
  with existing Open Source vocabularies. OmegaT recognizes valid dictionaries
  in that location and displays them. If the dictionary you want to use is
  already there and visible to OmegaT, you're done. If that is not the case,
  that is the list of available languages is empty, you can click
  <b>Install</b> and let OmegaT look for available vocabularies. Select the
  vocabularies in the pop-up window and then click <b>install</b>. The selected
  languages will then get installed and appear in the spell checker setup
  window (this may take a while ).</p>

  <p>Please note that the installer depends on the Internet list of
  dictionaries. OmegaT gets this list from <a href=
  "http://ftp.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/">
  OpenOffice.org/contrib/dictionaries</a>. In case it is out of date, you will
  have to hunt for the vocabularies yourself. Look for files with the name,
  indicating the language used and having extensions <i>aff</i> and <i>dic.</i>
  The OpenOffice.org Wiki contains probably the largest vocabulary collection
  in <a href=
  "http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries">OpenOffice.org Wiki
  Dictionaries</a>. The dictionaries compatible with OmegaT are the "Hunspell"
  or "Myspell" dictionaries.</p>

  <p>Make sure the language code of the target files corresponds to the
  dictionary's language code: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR
  target setting. You need to change the setting to FR-FR to have the spell
  checker recognize the correct dictionary for your target.</p>

  <h3><a name="Hints" id="Hints"></a>Hints</h3>

  <p>Possible reasons for the spell checker not working:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The check box “Automatically check the spelling of text” must be
      checked.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Check that the target language code of your project against the
      available vocabularies in the setup window. The spell checker determines
      the language to use from the target language code: if the target language
      is Brazilian Portuguese (PT_BR), the subdirectory with vocabularies must
      contain the two vocabulary files, called pt_br.aff and pt_br.dic.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>In case you have a large body of text already translated, but then realize
  the target language code of the project does not match the spell checker's
  language code (you specified en as the language, but there's no en
  vocabularies) you can simply copy the two corresponding files (for instance
  pt_PT.arr and pt_PT.dic) and rename the copies (to pt._BR.arr and pt_BR.dic).
  You may also change the language code in the project (from pt to pt_BR) ,
  however you will have to propagate this change through all the TMX files in
  the project, which is not the safest way to proceed.</p>

  <p>Note that Uninstall physically deletes the highlighted vocabularies. If
  they are part of OpenOffice as in the above case, they will disappear from
  that application too. If for whatever reason you have to do that now and
  again, it may make sense to copy the files involved to a different folder,
  reserved just for OmegaT purposes.</p>
