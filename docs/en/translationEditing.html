  <p>This dialogue window, available under Options &gt; Editing Behaviour..,
  lets the user determine, how the current segment be initialized and
  handled.</p>

  <h2><a name="auto_insert" id="auto_insert"></a>Automatic match insertion</h2>

  <p>You translate your files by moving from segment to segment, at the same
  time editing the current segment. When moving between segments, you may wish
  the editing field were populated with the existing translation or with the
  source text.</p>

  <p>In <strong>Options → Editing Behaviour...</strong> OmegaT offers you the
  following alternatives:</p>

  <table summary="just formatting" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <p><strong>The source text</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <p>you may automatically populate the editing field with the source
        text. This is pretty useful for the text containing many trade marks
        and other proper nouns you need to leave intact.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <p><strong>Leave the segment empty</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <p>OmegaT will leave the editing field blank. This option allows you to
        enter the translation without the need to remove the source text, thus
        saving you a pair of keystrokes (<code>Ctrl+A</code> and
        <code>Del</code>)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <p><strong>Insert the best fuzzy match</strong></p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <p>OmegaT will insert the translation of the string most similar to the
        current source, if it is above the similarity threshold, set in the
        dialogue (100% in the above case). If the match has been found, the
        target segment will get a prefix, specified in the Prefix text field
        ([fuzzy] in the example above). This makes it easy to search for
        pretranslated segments later.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2><a name="validation" id="validation"></a>Allow the translation to be
  equal to source</h2>

  <p>Documents you need to translate might contain trade marks, names or other
  proper nouns that have to be the same in translated documents. There are two
  strategies for segments that contain only such invariable text.</p>

  <p>You may decide not to translate such segments at all - as a result OmegaT
  will report these segments as not translated. This is the default.</p>

  <p>The alternative is to enter the translation even if it's equal to the
  source text, so that OmegaT remembers you have reviewed the text and decided
  to keep the target segment equal to the source. To be able to do so, go to
  <strong>Options → Editing Behaviour...</strong> and check the box
  <strong>Allow translation to be equal to source</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="Export" id="Export"></a>Export the segment to text files</h2>

  <p>You may prefer to leave the untranslated segments as they are and come
  back later to them. In this case you can activate the checkbox Allow the
  translation to be equal to source and OmegaT will save such source segments
  to a file to be translated later.</p>
