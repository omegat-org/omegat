  <h2>OmegaT and TMX files</h2><a name="TMX_files_location_and_purpose" id=
  "TMX_files_location_and_purpose"></a>

  <h3>TMX files - location and purpose</h3>

  <p>OmegaT uses TMX files in 3 separate locations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The <em>/omegat/</em> folder contains <em>project_save.tmx</em> and
      eventually a number of backup TMX files.</p>

      <p>The file <em>project_save.tmx</em> contains all the segments that have
      been memorized since you started the project.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The project main folder will contain 3 TMX files:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><em>project_name-omegat.tmx</em></li>

        <li><em>project_name-level1.tmx</em></li>

        <li><em>project_name-level2.tmx</em></li>
      </ol>(<i>project_name</i> being the name of your project).

      <p>These files contain the source and target segments corresponding to
      the contents of the /source/ folder at the time of their creation
      (usually when the translated files have been created).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <em>level1</em> file contains only textual information.</li>

        <li>The <em>level2</em> file encapsulates OmegaT specific tags in
        correct TMX tags so that the file can be used with its formatting
        information in a translation tool that supports TMX level 2 memories,
        or OmegaT itself.</li>

        <li>The <em>omegat</em> file includes OmegaT specific formating tags so
        that the file can be used in other OmegaT projects</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <em>/tm/</em> folder can contain any number of TMX files. Such
      files must be correct TMX files and can either contain only textual
      information (level 1 TMX), OmegaT textual and formatting information
      (omegat TMX) or TMX textual and formatting information (level 2 TMX). The
      differences between them are technical (see below for details), and if
      you wish to use a translation memory from a past project, they are
      largely interchangeable, i.e. they will all work equally well.</p>
    </li>

    <li><a name="TMX_backup" id="TMX_backup"></a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>TMX backup</h3>

  <p>When you translate your files, OmegaT stores all your progress in
  translation memory in the project's <em>/omegat</em> subdirectory.</p>

  <p>OmegaT also backups translation memory to
  <em>project_save.tmx.YEARMMDDHHNN.bak</em> in the same subfolder every
  time when a project is opened or reloaded. <em>YEAR</em> is 4-digit year,
  <em>MM</em> is a month, <em>DD</em> day of the month, <em>HH</em> and
  <em>NN</em> are hours and minutes when the previous translation memory was
  saved.</p>

  <p>If you think you have lost translation data follow this procedure:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>close the project</li>

    <li>rename the current <em>project_save.tmx</em> file to something you will
    remember (like <em>project_save.tmx.temporary</em> for example)</li>

    <li>select the backup translation memory that is the most likely to contain
    the data you are looking for</li>

    <li>rename it to <em>project_save.tmx</em></li>

    <li>open the project</li>
  </ol><a name="TMX_files_and_language" id="TMX_files_and_language"></a>

  <h3>TMX files and language</h3>

  <p>TMX files contain <i>translation units</i> that are made of a number of
  equivalent segments in different languages. A translation unit is made of at
  least two <i>translation unit variations</i> (tuv). Either can be used as
  source or target.</p>

  <p>The settings in your project will indicate which is the source language
  and which is the target language. OmegaT will thus take the
  <strong>tuv</strong> corresponding to the project source language code and
  use that segment as the source segment, and it will take the
  <strong>tuv</strong> corresponding to the project target language code and
  use that segment as the target segment. OmegaT recognizes them using the
  following two standard conventions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2 letters (e.g. <strong>JA</strong> for Japanese), or</li>

    <li>2-letter language code followed by the 2-letter country code (e.g.
    <strong>EN-US</strong>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>See <a href="languages.html">Languages</a> for a partial list of language
  and country codes.</p>

  <p>If the project language codes and the TMX language codes fully match, the
  segments are loaded in memory. If the codes match only the language but not
  the country, the segments are also loaded in memory. If neither the language
  code not the country code match, the segments are not loaded in memory.</p>

  <a name="keeping_a_memory" id="keeping_a_memory"></a>

  <h2>How OmegaT remembers your translations</h2>

  <p>The file project_save.tmx contains all the segments that have been
  memorized since you started the project. If you do any modification on the
  project segmentation for example, <em>project_save.tmx</em> will record new
  translation pairs but will retain all the previous information.</p>

  <p>This will occasionally lead to the display of <strong>orphan
  strings</strong> in the Match Viewer. Such matches no longer refer to
  segments existing in the source documents, but to segments recorded before
  the modifications took place. If the modification was a mistake, revert to
  the previous settings and the older recordings will reappear.</p>

  <a name="Using_TMs_from_previous_projects" id=
  "Using_TMs_from_previous_projects"></a>

  <h2>Using translation memories from previous projects</h2>

  <p>When you create the target documents in an OmegaT project, the translation
  memory of the project is output in the form of three files in the root folder
  of your OmegaT project (see the above description). You can regard these
  three TMX&nbsp;files (-<em>omegat.tmx</em>", "<em>-level1.tmx</em>" and
  "<em>-level2.tmx</em>") as an "export translation memory", i.e. as an
  exportable bilingual summary of your current project.</p>

  <p>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous project (for
  example because the new project is similar to the previous project, or uses
  terminology which might have been used before), you can use these translation
  memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for import into your new
  project. In this case, place the translation memories you wish to use in the
  <em>\tm</em> folder of your new project.</p>

  <p>By default, the <em>\tm</em> folder is below the project's root folder
  (e.g. ..<em>\MyProject\tm)</em>, but you can choose a different folder in the
  project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you frequently use
  translation memories produced in the past, for example because they are on
  the same subject or for the same customer. In this case, a useful procedure
  would be:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a folder (a "repository folder") in a convenient location on
    your hard drive for the translation memories for a particular customer or
    subject.</li>

    <li>Whenever you finish a project, copy one of the three "export"
    translation memory files from the root folder of the project to the
    repository folder.</li>

    <li>When you begin a new project on the same subject or for the same
    customer, navigate to the repository folder in the <em>Project &gt;
    Properties &gt; Edit Project</em> dialog and select it as the translation
    memory folder.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that all the TMX&nbsp;files in the <em>/tm</em> repository get parsed
  during the startup of the program, so putting in all the TMX&nbsp;files you
  can get your hands on will unnecessarily slow down OmegaT. You may even
  consider eliminating those that are strictly necessary (for example by
  leaving them in the <em>/tm</em> subdirectory, but changing their extension),
  once their contents have migrated to the <em>project_save.tmx</em> of your
  current project.</p>

  <h2>Using memories created by other translation tools</h2>

  <h3><a name=
  "importing_files" id="importing_files"></a>Importing files</h3>

  <p>OmegaT supports importing TMX versions 1.1-1.4b (both level 1 and level
  2). This enables the translation memories produced by other tools to be read
  by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not <i>fully</i> support imported level 2 TMX
  files (that store not only the translation, but also the formatting), so the
  quality of fuzzy matches will be a bit lower when importing level 2 TMX
  files.</p>

  <h3><a name=
  "imported_files_handling" id="imported_files_handling"></a>Imported files handling</h3>

  <p>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when handling translation memory
  files (TMX files). If any mistake is found in such a file, OmegaT will simply
  not load it.</p>

  <p>Some tools are known to produce invalid TMX files in certain conditions.
  If you want to use such files as reference translations in OmegaT, they will
  need to be fixed if OmegaT refuses them. Fixes are trivial operations and
  OmegaT will give you indications in the related error message. You can ask
  the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/">user group</a> for advice
  if you have problems.</p>

  <h2>Using OmegaT translation memories in other translation tools</h2>

  <p>OmegaT exports TMX files version 1.4 (both level 1 and level 2). The level
  2 export is not a standard level 2 but is enough to generate correct matches
  in TMX Level 2 supporting translation tools. If you only need textual
  information (and not formatting information), use the level 1 file that
  OmegaT has created.</p>

  <a name="upgrading_TM" id="upgrading_TM"></a>

  <h2>Upgrading translation memories</h2>

  <p>Previous versions of OmegaT were capable of segmenting source files into
  paragraphs only, and were inconsistently numbering formatting tags in HTML
  and Open Document files. OmegaT 1.8 can detect and upgrade such TMX files on
  the fly to increase fuzzy matching quality and leverage your existing
  translation better -- so that you don't have to redo it.</p>

  <p>A project's TMX will be upgraded only once, and will be written in
  upgraded form, and legacy TMX files will be upgraded on the fly each time the
  project is loaded. Note that some changes in file filters in OmegaT 1.8 may
  lead to totally different segmentation, thus in rare cases you will have to
  upgrade your translation manually.</p>
