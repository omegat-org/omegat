  <h2>OmegaT main window</h2><img src="images/OmegaT_panes.png" name="grafika1"
  alt="OmegaT panes" align="left" width="756" height="577" border="0" id=
  "grafika1"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Main window consists of three panes, main menu and a status bar.You can
  change the position of any pane or even undock it to a separate window by
  dragging the pane by its name. Depending on the pane status, different signs
  can appear at its top right corner:</p>

  <p><img src="images/Minimize.gif" name="graphics1" alt="Minimize" align=
  "bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics1"> reduces the pane
  to show only its name at the bottom near the status bar.<br>
  <img src="images/Maximize.gif" name="graphics2" alt="Maximize" align="bottom"
  width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics2"> makes the pane take all the
  available window space.<br>
  <img src="images/Restore.gif" name="graphics3" alt="Restore" align="bottom"
  width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics3"> puts the pane back where it
  was before before it was minimized or maximized.<br>
  <img src="images/Undock.gif" name="graphics4" alt="Undock" align="bottom"
  width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics4"> detaches the pane from the
  main window to a separate window of its own.<br>
  <img src="images/Dock.gif" name="graphics5" alt="Dock" align="bottom" width=
  "18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics5"> puts the pane back within the
  main window.</p>

  <p>It is also possible to put the panes so that they overlap. In this case
  the panes will display a tab at their top. Clicking on the tab will put the
  pane on the foreground. The separators between the panes can be dragged to
  resize panes.</p>

  <h3><a name="Editor" id="Editor"></a>Editor pane</h3>

  <p>Here you'll type and edit the translation. Editor pane displays the text
  of the partially translated document: the text already translated is
  displayed translated, and the text not yet translated is displayed in the
  original language. The displayed text is split into segments, and you may
  scroll through the document and double-click on any segment to edit it. In
  the above case the already translated segments are shown in yellow, but you
  may change the setup to suit your preferences (see menu <a href=
  "menu.html">View).</a></p>

  <p>One of the segments is the active segment. It is the only one that is
  displayed in two parts: the upper part is in the original language, in bold
  characters with a green background color, the lower part is the editing
  field, delimited by two markers: the leftmost marker is
  <strong><code>&lt;segment nnnn&gt;</code></strong> where
  <strong><code>nnnn</code></strong> is a number of the segment in the project,
  the rightmost marker is <strong><code>&lt;end segment&gt;</code></strong>.
  You use the upper part as a reference and overwrite or modify the contents of
  the editing field with your translation.</p>

  <p>Depending on the <a href="translationEditing.html">Editing behaviour</a>
  the editing field for the untranslated segment may be empty, contain the
  source text or the translation of the string most similar to the one you are
  going to translate. When you move to another segment, the translation is
  validated and stored. If you want the segment to stay untranslated, simply
  make the editing field empty by removing all the text (select all with
  <code>Ctrl+A</code> and delete with <code>Del</code>). OmegaT may remember a
  translation when it is identical to the source. It is useful for documents
  that contain trade marks, names or other proper nouns, or parts in a third
  language that does not require translation.</p>

  <p>See <a href="translationEditing.html">Translation editing</a> for more
  details.</p>

  <h3><a name="Match" id="Match"></a>Match viewer</h3><img src=
  "images/MatchesPane.png" name="grafika2" alt="OmegaT Match pane" align="left"
  width="417" height="356" border="0" id="grafika2"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Match viewer shows the most similar segments from <a href=
  "translationMemories.html">translation memories</a>, both from project
  translation memory created while you translate your project, and from legacy
  translation memories you import from your earlier jobs, or you may receive
  from your client or translation agency.</p>

  <p>When you move to the next segment, the first fuzzy match (the one with the
  best matching percentage) is automatically selected. You may <a href=
  "menu.html#shortcuts">select</a> another one by pressing <code>Ctrl+2</code>,
  <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, or <code>5.</code>Of course, pressing
  <code>Ctrl+5</code> will do nothing, if there is no match #5.</p>

  <p>To use the <strong>selected</strong> match in your translation, use
  <code><a href="menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+R</a></code> to replace the target
  field with that match or use <code><a href=
  "menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+I</a></code> to insert it at the cursor
  position.</p>

  <p>The matching percentage is roughly equivalent to taking the number of
  common words in the matched and the matching segment and dividing by the
  number of words in the longest of the two. The selected fuzzy match will be
  highlighted in <strong>bold</strong>, words that are missing from the segment
  you translate will be colored in <strong><font color=
  "#0000FF">blue</font></strong> and word adjacent to missing parts in
  <font color="#00FF00"><b>green</b></font>. In the above example the source
  segment is <strong><i>Information about Java &amp; OmegaT.</i></strong> The
  top match is 75%, because 3 out of 4 words (with &amp; getting ignored)
  match. The line with the matching percentage also includes to source TMX,
  where the match has been found. If there's no file name displayed, the source
  is the default project translation memory. Orphan segments (the match #4)
  describe segments in the default project translation memory without the
  corresponding source segment.</p>

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <h3><a name="Glossary" id="Glossary"></a>Glossary</h3>

  <p>Glossary pane features terminology translation loaded from <a href=
  "glossaries.html">glossary files</a>. It shows translation of terms found in
  the current segment, but it only shows it for reference purposes, and does
  not allow to insert or replace the term with its translation.</p><img src=
  "images/Glossary_pane.png" name="grafika3" alt="OmegaT Glossary pane" align=
  "left" width="328" height="150" border="0" id="grafika3"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The source segment in the above example was “<i>In most translation jobs
  it is considered important to have the translated document look similar to
  the original.</i>”, and two words in it, document and translation were found
  in the glossary file. OmegaT also supports multi-word terms, but in a very
  basic manner: if both words of a term are found in current segment, the term
  will be displayed.</p>

  <h3><a name="menu" id="menu"></a>Main menu</h3>

  <p>Obviously, you can use main menu to access all OmegaT functions. See the
  <a href="menu.html#menu">Main Menu</a> appendix for a full description of all
  menu's and menu items. The most often used functions are accessible with
  <a href="menu.html#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a>, so once you get
  accustomed to them, there will no longer be any need to browse through the
  menus while translating.</p>

  <h3><a name="bar" id="bar"></a>Status bar</h3>

  <p>The status bar displays work flow related messages at the bottom of the
  main window. This bar gives the user feedback messages about specific
  operations that are in progress. It also displays the number of fuzzy and
  glossary matches for the current segment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="other_windows" id="other_windows"></a>Other windows</h2>

  <h3><a name="files" id="files"></a>Project files</h3>

  <p>Project Files window lists the project files and displays other project
  information. It is displayed automatically when OmegaT loads a project. To
  close it, use <code>esc</code>, to open it or call it to the front use
  <code>Ctrl+L</code>.</p>

  <h3><a name="proj_files" id="proj_files"></a>Project Files Window
  features</h3>

  <p>The following information is displayed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>the list of all the translatable files in the project.These are the
      files present in the source files folder, that <a href=
      "filesToTranslate.html">OmegaT can handle</a>. Clicking on any file will
      open it for translation</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>the file currently available in the Editor pane is highlighted with a
      blue background</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>the number of segments in each file is shown next to file name.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>the number of unique segments in the whole project.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>the number of unique segments already translated. It is updated each
      time you translate a segment.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="unique" id="unique"></a>Unique segments</h3>

  <p>The set of <strong>Unique</strong> segments is computed by taking all the
  segments and removing all the duplicate segments equal up to letter case
  ("Run" and "run" are thought different).</p>

  <p>The difference between "Number of segments" and "Number of unique
  segments" gives you a rough idea of the number of repetitions in the text.
  Note however, that the numbers do not say how relevant the repetitions are:
  it could mean relatively long sentences repeated a number of times (very
  lucky!) or it could describe a table of keywords (not as lucky...) The
  <code>project_stats.txt</code> located in the <code>/omegat</code> folder of
  your project contains more detailed segment information per file.</p>

  <p>It is possible to modify the number of segments/unique segments by
  modifying the segmentation rules. This, however, should be avoided at all
  costs, once you have started translating the project. See the <a href=
  "segmentation.html">Segmentation rules</a> for more information.</p>

  <h3><a name="adding_files" id="adding_files"></a>Adding files to the
  project</h3>

  <p>You may add source files to the project by clicking on the "Import Source
  Files..." button. It copies the selected files to the <code>/source</code>
  directory and reloads the project to load the new files. You can also add
  source files from internet pages, written in MediaWiki, by clicking on
  "Import from MediaWiki" button and providing the corresponding URL.</p>

  <h3><a name="search" id="search"></a>Search window</h3>

  <p>You'll use search window to find specific segments in the project. There
  can be several search windows open simultaneously. To open a new one, use
  <code><a href="menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+F</a></code> in main window. The
  search window consists of a text field for search string or keywords, flags
  and radio buttons for setting up the search and a display area containing the
  results of the search.</p>

  <h3><a name="search_types" id="search_types"></a>Search types</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>There are two <a href="searches.html#searchmethods">types</a> of search
    available:</dt>

    <dt><strong>exact searches -</strong> look for the specified query string
    within the current project or in any directory or directory tree.</dt>

    <dt><strong>keyword searches -</strong> examine the current project and
    return all the segments containing all of the query words, in any
    order.</dt>
  </dl>

  <p>Searches are made on both the source and translation. You may also search
  within any directory, but bear in mind that OmegaT can search only in
  <a href="filesToTranslate.html">files it supports</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="wildcards_regexp" id="wildcards_regexp"></a>Wildcards and
  regular expressions</h3>

  <p>Searches supports the <a href="searches.html#usingwildcards">wild card
  characters</a> * and ? as well as <a href=
  "searches.html#usingregularexpressions">regular expressions</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="search_display" id="search_display"></a>Search results
  display</h3>

  <p>Pressing the search button after entering a string in the search field
  will display all the segments in the project that include the searched
  string. As OmegaT handles all the identical segments as one entity, only the
  first unique segment is shown. The segments are displayed in order of
  appearance in the project. Translated segments will be displayed with the
  original text at the top and the translated text at the bottom, non
  translated segments will be displayed in original text only.</p>

  <p>You may click on a segment to bring it up in the Editor for modification.
  Then you may switch back to Search window and go to the next found segment to
  modify it too. Such a pattern is useful to do terminology updates.</p>

  <h3><a name="tag_validation" id="tag_validation"></a>Tag validation</h3>

  <p>The tag validation window detects the tag errors in the translation and
  lists them. To open the window, use <code><a href=
  "menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+T</a></code>. The window features a 3 column table
  with a a link to the segment and its source and target contents:</p>

  <p><img src="images/TagValidator.png" name="grafika4" alt=
  "OmegaT Tag Validator" align="left" width="556" height="318" border="0" id=
  "grafika4"><br clear="left">
  <br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The tags are highlighted in bold blue for easy comparison between the
  original and the translated contents. Click on the link to jump to the
  segment in the Editor pane. Correct the error if necessary and press
  <code><a href="menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+T</a></code> to return to the tag
  validation window to correct other errors. In the first and third case above
  tags are paired incorrectly, and in the second case the starting tag is
  missing the &lt; sign.</p>

  <p><a href="formattedText.html#intro">Tag</a> errors are <a href=
  "formattedText.html#tag_operation">tag manipulations</a> in the translation
  that do not reproduce the same tag order and number as in the original
  segment. Some tag manipulations are necessary and are benign, some will cause
  problems when the translated document is created. Tags generally represent
  some kind of formatting in the original text. <strong>Simplifying the
  original text formating</strong> greatly contributes to reducing the number
  of tags.</p>

  <h3>Help browser</h3>

  <p>The help browser (which displays this manual) can be called by pressing
  <a href="menu.html#shortcuts">F1</a> or calling <strong>Help → User
  Manual...</strong> in <a href="menu.html">main menu</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="manual" id="manual"></a>Help browser navigation</h3>

  <p>In the window you'll see the manual and two buttons: <strong>Back</strong>
  and <strong>Contents</strong>. The user manual is an HTML document with links
  to different chapters. Clicking on a link as you would do in a web browser
  brings the desired page to the front.</p>

  <h3>User manual off line browsing</h3>

  <p>The user manual is located in the <code>doc</code> subfolder under the
  OmegaT installation folder, so you may view, for instance, English
  documentation, by opening the <code>doc/en/index.html</code> file in your
  browser. This way you will be able to follow external links too, as the
  built-in help browser does not accept external Internet links.</p>
