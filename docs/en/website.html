  <h2>OmegaT on the web</h2>

  <h3>OmegaT sites and OmegaT SourceForge project</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT web site</a> contains links to
  various OmegaT resources, so you should probably start there. User support is
  provided on a volunteer basis at the <a href=
  "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/">OmegaT Yahoo User Group</a>. The
  <a href=
  "http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/database?method=reportRows&amp;tbl=1">
  FAQ</a> corner there may be a good start for your questions. OmegaT also has
  an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel on FreeNode: #omegat. New versions of
  OmegaT can be downloaded from <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/">OmegaT SourceForge.net Project</a>,
  where you may also file <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&amp;atid=520347">bug
  reports</a> and <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&amp;atid=520350">requests for
  enhancements</a>.</p>

  <h3>Bug reports</h3>

  <p>Remember that every good bug report needs exactly three things:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Steps to reproduce</li>

    <li>What you expected to see</li>

    <li>What you saw instead</li>
  </ul>

  <p>More in <a href=
  "http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">Painless Bug
  Tracking</a> article by Joel Spolsky</p>

  <p>You should add copies of files, portions of the log (see <em>OmegaT Files
  and Directories &gt; User files</em> location) , screen shots, anything that
  you think will help the developers to find and fix your bug. Note that bug
  reports and requests for enhancements are publicly visible, so you should not
  add any sensitive files. If you want to keep track of what is happening to
  the report you should register as a SourceForge user, login and file a bug
  report being logged in, or simply click Monitor on top of the report.</p>
