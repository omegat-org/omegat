# Guideline for Welcoming Beginners

## For Project Managers:

1. **Create Beginner-Friendly Documentation:**
   - Ensure that there is clear and comprehensive documentation available for beginners. This should include
    installation instructions, setup guides, and an overview of the project structure.

2. **Label Issues Appropriately:**
   - Use labels "good first issue" to identify tasks suitable for beginners. This makes it easier for them
    to find a starting point.

3. **Provide Code Review and Feedback:**
   - Encourage experienced contributors to review and provide constructive feedback on code submitted by beginners.
    This helps them learn and improve their skills.

4. **Maintain a Helpful and Inclusive Environment:**
   - Foster a culture of kindness, patience, and inclusivity within the community. Encourage respectful communication
    and be mindful of diverse perspectives.

## For Contributors:

1. **Be Patient and Supportive:**
   - When interacting with beginners, be patient and understanding. Remember that everyone starts somewhere,
    and your help can make a significant impact on their learning journey.

2. **Provide Clear Instructions:**
   - When explaining tasks or issues, provide step-by-step instructions and, if applicable, share relevant code
    snippets or examples.

3. **Encourage Exploration:**
   - Encourage beginners to explore the project's codebase and ask questions. This helps them gain a deeper
   understanding of the project's architecture.

4. **Review Pull Requests Thoroughly:**
   - When reviewing contributions from beginners, focus on providing constructive feedback rather than simply
    pointing out mistakes.

5. **Offer to Pair Program:**
   - If possible, offer to pair program with beginners on more complex tasks. This can be an excellent learning
    experience for them.
