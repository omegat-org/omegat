# How to build the HTML manuals from source

## Requirements

The OmegaT project provides a Gradle configuration to build the manuals using a container execution environment.

Theoretically, all the OCI-compatible container execution environments are supported. We tested both the Apache 2.0 licensed [containerd and nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) and the non-free [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), sold by Docker Inc.

OmegaT supports both `nerdctl` and `docker` command. If the `nerdctl` or `docker` commands are not in your path, all the documentation generation tasks will be skipped.

### Container runtimes

The standards and FLOSS communities have provided users with a powerful set of container execution tools:

- Runtime environment: containerd, kubernetes
- Toolset: nerdctl, podman
- Integrated environment: Rancher Desktop

### Rancher Desktop

Rancher Desktop is an Electron-based application that wraps other tools while providing a simple user experience.

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)

#### on macOS

On macOS, Rancher Desktop uses a virtual machine to run `containerd`. It also provides custom Lima machines with `nerdctl`.

Lima project provides Linux virtual machines for macOS, with built-in integration for `nerdctl`. There is an alternative project called `colima` (container for Linux on Mac) that provides container runtimes on macOS with minimal setup.

Rancher desktop supports both intel mac and arm mac.

#### on Windows

Rancher Desktop uses `containerd` on WSL2 and `nerdctl` on Windows.

#### on Linux

Rancher Desktop has requirements that are detailed [here](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/#linux).

### containerd/nerdctl and rootless mode on Linux

The OmegaT build system supports working in rootless mode.

#### Installation

Download the release files from [the project](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/releases).

```
bash
tar Cxzvvf /usr/local nerdctl-full-1.7.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

And follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/main/docs/rootless.md)

### Generating the documentation

Make sure the container execution environment is running before launching the building task.

#### generating the First Steps page (OmegaT 6.0 and later)

OmegaT 6.0 and later display a "First Steps" page in the Editor pane at launch. That page is built with the following command:

```
bash
$ ./gradlew firstSteps
```

The generated pages will be found in `build/docs/greetings/<lang>/`.

#### generating the HTML manuals and the available language index page

The HTML manuals and the available language index page are built with the following command:

```
bash
$ ./gradlew updateManuals
```

The manuals are found in `build/docs/manual/`. The available languages index page is at `build/docs/manual/index.html`.

#### generating the Instant Start Guides (OmegaT 5.7 and before)

OmegaT 5.7 and before display an "Instant Start" page in the Editor pane at launch. That page is built with the following command:

```
bash
$ ./gradlew instantStartGuides
```

The generated pages will be found in `build/docs/greetings/<lang>/`.

## Document generation under the hood

Document generation is done with the `ant` build configuration in the `docgen` container image.
`doc_src/docgen` is a shell script that is launched from the Gradle build system.
Arguments to `docgen` are the same as the arguments to `ant` described below.

See also:

- [docgen-docker](https://github.com/omegat-org/docgen-docker): source for the docgen container

## Inside the container image

-> Do we need all the information about macOS and Windows now?

### Dependencies

The creation of the documentation requires a number of tools:

- DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.75.2 ("dbk") or above
  [https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets](https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets)
- DocBook XML 4.5 ("docbook-xml-4.5")
  [https://docbook.org/xml/4.5/](https://docbook.org/xml/4.5/)
- fop 1.1 ("fop-1.1")
  [https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/1.1/](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/1.1/)
- libxml2 2-2.7.7 ("libxml2-2.7.7")
  [http://xmlsoft.org](http://xmlsoft.org)
- Saxon 6-5-5 ("saxon")
  [https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/)
- XMLmind Web Help Compiler ("whc")
  [https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml](https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml)
- Ant 1.7.1 or above ("apache-ant")
  [https://ant.apache.org](https://ant.apache.org)

### Path to the DTD

For efficiency reason, the path to the DTD in the DocBook files (e.g.,
`AboutOmegaT.xml`) has been changed to a local path
(`../../../docbook-xml-4.5/docbookx.dtd` instead of an `http://`
reference). Depending on the actual configuration, it might be changed to a
standard reference (`http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd`) or
to another local reference.

### Windows

dbk must be installed at the root of `C:`

    C:\dbk\common
    C:\dbk\docsrc
    ⋮

docbook-xml-4.5 must be installed at the same level as your OmegaT development
folder.

So, if you have

    C:\dev\omegat-trunk
    C:\dev\omegat-trunk\src
    C:\dev\omegat-trunk\doc_src
    ⋮

you would have

    C:\dev\docbook-xml-4.5\ent
    C:\dev\docbook-xml-4.5\calstblx.dtd
    ⋮

libxml2-2.7.7 and apache-ant must be installed where a path can find them,
usually in Program Files.

    C:\Program Files\libxml2-2.7.7.win32
    C:\Program Files\apache-ant

Corresponding `path`:

    path=C:\Program Files\libxml2-2.7.7.win32\bin;C:\Program Files\apache-ant\bin

fop-1.1 can be installed anywhere, usually in Program Files.

    C:\Program Files\fop-1.1

The location of fop-1.1, dbk and Saxon must be set in `doc_src_paths.xml`,
in the corresponding properties:

    <property name="fop.home" value="C:\Program Files\fop-1.1" />

Alternatively, it is possible to set the values of `fop.home.lib` and
`fop.home.build` separately:

    <property name="fop.home.lib" value="C:\Program Files (x86)\fop-1.1\lib" />
    <property name="fop.home.build" value="C:\Program Files (x86)\fop-1.1\build" />

    <property name="dbk" value="c:\dbk" />
    <property name="saxon" value="C:\Program Files\saxon6-5-5\saxon.jar" />

The location of dbk must also be set in `docbook-utf8.xsl`:

    <xsl:import href="file:///c:\dbk\html\docbook.xsl"/>

Both `doc_src_paths.xml` and `docbook-utf8.xsl` must be copied at the same level
as your OmegaT development folder.

    C:\dev\doc_src_paths.xml
    C:\dev\docbook-utf8.xsl

The ones available in `doc_src` are only there for reference.

### macOS
#### Dependencies

All the dependencies can be installed through
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) except for saxon and whc.

    sudo port install apache-ant docbook-xml-4.5 docbook-xsl-nons fop libxml2

- Saxon 6-5-5 ("saxon")
  [https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/)

- XMLmind Web Help Compiler ("whc")
  [https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml](https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml)

Unzip the downloaded packages and put them in your prefered location. The
example below uses the `/Applications` folder.

#### Paths

If you use Macports, the `doc_src_paths.xml` settings are:

    <project>
        <property name="fop.home" value="/opt/local/share/java/fop/1.1" />
        <property name="dbk" value="/opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl-nons" />
        <property name="saxon" value="/Applications/saxon6-5-5/saxon.jar" />
	    <property name="whc" value="/Application/whc-3_3_0/lib/whc.jar" />
    </project>

and the `docbook-utf8.xsl` settings are:

    <xsl:import href="file:///opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl-nons/html/docbook.xsl"/>

#### DocBook 4.5 installation

Create a symbolic link from the installed DocBook 4.5 files to the location
where the build process will look for the DocBook DTD: the folder "above"
`doc_src` in the OmegaT source tree:

    ln -s /opt/local/share/xml/docbook/4.5 /path/to/omegat/docbook-xml-4.5

#### Settings files

The modified `doc_src_paths.xml` and `docbook-utf8.xsl` must be copied to the
same location as `docbook-xml-4.5`.

    /path/to/omegat/doc_src/en/
       └────/docbook-xml-4.5/
       └────/doc_src_paths.xml
	   └────/docbook-utf8.xsl


# Fonts

-> Aren't the fonts installed in the container?

The following fonts must be installed:

- Latin: [DejaVu Sans](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)
- Japanese: [IPA P
  Gothic](https://ipafont.ipa.go.jp/old/ipafont/download.html#en)
- Chinese: [WenQuanYi Micro
  Hei](http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi?action=browse&id=Home&lang=en)

# Usage

-> Is this part still relevant?

All the scripts require the language folder as argument and must be run from the
`doc_src` directory.

Note: Replace `ant` with `docgen` if you are using the `docgen` script.
