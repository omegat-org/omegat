# Building the documentation manually

## scripts, configuration, styles, and a template

There are several scripts, common configuration, styles, and a template among languages.

- `doc_src/docgen`: shell script to launch container to produce manuals.
- `build.xml`: Main configuration of ANT build tool.
- `doc_src_paths.xml`: Set the paths for utilities.
- `docbook-utf8.xsl`: Allows issuing the First Steps in UTF-8
- `fop.xconf`: Configuration for fop tool to produce PDF from a docbook source.
- `index_template.html`: Template for `index.html` web manual default page.
- `lang_exceptions.properties`: List of languages to skip a manual build.
- `OmegaT_new.css`: Stylesheet for HTML5 manuals and First Steps.
- `OmegaT_old.css`: Stylesheet for HTML manuals with languages that manual version is 4 or before.
- `whc-header.xsl`,`whc-index.xsl`,`whc-toc.xsl`: XSL for whc tool kit.

### Setting files for a specific environment

The modified `doc_src_paths.xml` and `docbook-utf8.xsl` must be copied to the
same location as `docbook-xml-4.5`.

    /path/to/omegat/doc_src/en/
       └────/docbook-xml-4.5/
       └────/doc_src_paths.xml
	   └────/docbook-utf8.xsl

## command line examples

All the scripts require the language folder as argument and must be run from the
`doc_src` directory.
If you want to build with `ant`, you must install all the requirements on your environment.
You can also generate with container image, please refer a section
[Use a container to build the documentation](07.ManualBuildUsingContainer.md)

### Building First Steps only

    ant -Dlanguage=en -Dtarget=../docs/en first-steps

### Building everything except Javahelp:

    ant -Dlanguage=en -Dtarget=../docs/en 

### Building HTML

    ant -Dlanguage=en -Dtarget=../docs/en html5

### Building PDF

    ant -Dlanguage=en -Dtarget=../docs/en pdf

### Building Javahelp

    ant -Dlanguage=en -Dtarget=../docs/en javahelp


## Dependencies

The creation of the documentation requires a number of tools to build HTML5 manuals:

- DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.79.2 ("dbk") or above
  [https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets](https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets)
- DocBook XML 4.5 ("docbook-xml-4.5")
  [https://docbook.org/xml/4.5/](https://docbook.org/xml/4.5/)
- libxml2 2-2.12.4 ("libxml2-2.12.4")
  [http://xmlsoft.org](http://xmlsoft.org)
- Saxon 6-5-5 ("saxon")
  [https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/saxon6/)
- XMLmind Web Help Compiler 3.5_1 ("whc")
  [https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml](https://www.xmlmind.com/ditac/whc.shtml)
- Ant 1.7.1 or above ("apache-ant")
  [https://ant.apache.org](https://ant.apache.org)

There are more requirements, a tool and fonts, to generate PDF:

- fop 2.9 ("fop-2.9")
  [https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.9/](https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.9/)

The following fonts must be installed that are used to embed into PDF file:

- Latin: [DejaVu Sans](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)
- Japanese: [Noto Sans CJK JP](https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/NotoSansCJKjp-hinted.zip)
- Chinese: [Noto Sans CJK SC](https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/NotoSansCJKjp-hinted.zip)

## Installation

### Path to the DTD

For efficiency reason, the path to the DTD in the DocBook files (e.g.,
`AboutOmegaT.xml`) has been changed to a local path
(`../../../docbook-xml-4.5/docbookx.dtd` instead of an `http://`
reference). Depending on the actual configuration, it might be changed to a
standard reference (`http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.5/docbookx.dtd`) or
to another local reference.

### Windows

dbk must be installed at the root of `C:`

    C:\dbk\common
    C:\dbk\docsrc
    ⋮

docbook-xml-4.5 must be installed at the same level as your OmegaT development
folder.

So, if you have

    C:\dev\omegat
    C:\dev\omegat\src
    C:\dev\omegat\doc_src
    ⋮

you would have

    C:\dev\docbook-xml-4.5\ent
    C:\dev\docbook-xml-4.5\calstblx.dtd
    ⋮

libxml2-2.12.4 and apache-ant must be installed where a path can find them,
usually in Program Files.

    C:\Program Files\libxml2-2.12.4.win32
    C:\Program Files\apache-ant

Corresponding `path`:

    path=C:\Program Files\libxml2-2.12.4.win32\bin;C:\Program Files\apache-ant\bin

fop-1.1 can be installed anywhere, usually in Program Files.

    C:\Program Files\fop-2.9

The location of fop-2.9, dbk and Saxon must be set in `doc_src_paths.xml`,
in the corresponding properties:

    <property name="fop.home" value="C:\Program Files\fop-2.9" />

Alternatively, it is possible to set the values of `fop.home.lib` and
`fop.home.build` separately:

    <property name="fop.home.lib" value="C:\Program Files (x86)\fop-2.9\lib" />
    <property name="fop.home.build" value="C:\Program Files (x86)\fop-2.9\build" />

    <property name="dbk" value="c:\dbk" />
    <property name="saxon" value="C:\Program Files\saxon6-5-5\saxon.jar" />

The location of dbk must also be set in `docbook-utf8.xsl`:

    <xsl:import href="file:///c:\dbk\html\docbook.xsl"/>

Both `doc_src_paths.xml` and `docbook-utf8.xsl` must be copied at the same level
as your OmegaT development folder.

    C:\dev\doc_src_paths.xml
    C:\dev\docbook-utf8.xsl

The ones available in `doc_src` are only there for reference.

### macOS

All the dependencies can be installed through
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) except for saxon and whc.

    sudo port install apache-ant docbook-xml-4.5 docbook-xsl-nons fop libxml2

Please download and extract saxon and whc and unzip the downloaded packages,
and put them in your preferred location.
The example below uses the `/Applications` folder.

#### Paths

If you use Macports, the `doc_src_paths.xml` settings are:

    <project>
        <property name="fop.home" value="/opt/local/share/java/fop/2.9" />
        <property name="dbk" value="/opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl-nons" />
        <property name="saxon" value="/Applications/saxon6-5-5/saxon.jar" />
	    <property name="whc" value="/Application/whc-3_5_1/lib/whc.jar" />
    </project>

and the `docbook-utf8.xsl` settings are:

    <xsl:import href="file:///opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl-nons/html/docbook.xsl"/>

#### DocBook 4.5 installation

Create a symbolic link from the installed DocBook 4.5 files to the location
where the build process will look for the DocBook DTD: the folder "above"
`doc_src` in the OmegaT source tree:

    ln -s /opt/local/share/xml/docbook/4.5 /path/to/omegat/docbook-xml-4.5
