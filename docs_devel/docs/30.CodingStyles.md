# Coding styles

OmegaT project uses following coding style rules and coding policy.

## Code Style Basics

* Each java file has a GPL3 copyright header. OmegaT has a unit test to check header.
* Source code has a maximum 120 characters in each line.
* The Maximum line length of comments in sources is 80 characters 
* Indentation is 4 spaces. Don't use TAB character.
* We don't use asterisk import. You should expand all individual imports.
* You are recommended to put javadoc comments for all your public methods.
* We don't set method arguments "final", but you are recommended to treat it as final.

## I18N/L10N/Bundles

* Bundle properties should be ASCII, 7bit clean. All translations should be escaped.
  - It will change to be UTF-8 after OmegaT version 6.1 beta release.

## API design

* Stable APIs should be under "org.omegat.core" package.
* Should not remove API, otherwise, please give `@Deprecation` for old API.
* Please care for backward compatibility, please mind plugin developers.

## Swing GUI design

* We use a Java Swing technology for GUI parts.
* GUI parts can be;
  - written by hand, or
  - Use [NetBeans GUI builder](https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorial/main/kb/docs/java/quickstart-gui/)
* We don't accept other GUI builder materials;
  - such as JetBrains IntelliJ GUI builder, JForm Designer, Eclipse Window builder.
  - If you want, you are recommended to implement it as a plugin.
* We encourage developers to take an approach of MVC design.
* You can design GUI parts as View, such as `o.o.g.p.v.AppearancePreferencePanel` class.
* You can write logics as Controller, such as `o.o.g.p.v.AppearanceContoller` class.
* Sometimes a custom Model is required for complex design, such as `o.o.g.p.v.PluginInfoTableModel`

## XML parser

* We move XML parser to be StAX based instead of JAXB because of performance.
  - We use [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) XML serialization library.

## Modules

* We split Machine Translation service connectors, Aligner, Spell Checker driver and
  dictionary drivers as sub project and build as modules.
* Modules are installed in "<omegat app root>/modules" instead of "<omegat app root>/plugins"

## language and characters

- OmegaT project uses UTF-8 characters for comments in java source file in general.
- You should use English for comment language.
- You should use ASCII characters and 7bit clean for variable names, method names et. al.
- You are allowed to use String literals in UTF-8 encoding.
- You should use Bundle for localization strings.
- You can not use Right-to-Left direction characters in comments and code body.
- You can not use invisible characters such as non-breakable-space and tab.
- When you need invisible characters in literals, please use unicode escape.

## Lint check

OmegaT project configures a build script with several linting tools.
You can check your code with;

```bash
./gradlew check
```

### Checkstyle

You can check your code with Checkstyle linting tool.
A project configuration is stored in `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
We treat checkstyle lint error as warning, but you are recommended to
improve your code before sending your patch to the core team.

### Spotless code formatter

Spotless is a general purpose code formatting tool that makes code spotless.
It will help you to format your changed code just a command

```bash
./gradlew spotlessChangedApply
```

OmegaT uses Spotless plugin for gradle and configured with [eclipse formatting configuration](assets/eclipse-formatting.
xml)
This XML file is project-standard indent configuration for Eclipse IDE, but also uses as spotless formatting rule.

There is other sample config file for IDE such as [JetBrains IntelliJ Project configuration](assets/intellij-Project.
xml).
