# Building installer package

## Building Windows installer

### Inno Setup

We use `Inno Setup` to build windows' installer binary.
Inno Setup is a free installer for Windows programs by Jordan Russell
and Martijn Laan. First introduced in 1997, Inno Setup today rivals
and even surpasses many commercial installers in a feature set and stability.

We can download Inno Setup executable binary that can run on Windows.
It is also able to run with WINE on linux.

There is a docker image built with WINE and linux.
