# Building installer package and test it

## Building Windows installer

OmegaT project uses `Launch4j` for application launcher and uses
InnoSetup version 6 to build installer and package into distribution.

### Launch4j

`Launch4j` is a cross-platform tool for wrapping Java applications distributed as
jars in lightweight Windows native executables. The executable can be configured
to search for a certain JRE version or use a bundled one, and it's possible to
set runtime options, like the initial/max heap size.

The wrapper also provides better user experience through an application icon,
a native pre-JRE splash screen, and a Java download page in case the appropriate
JRE cannot be found.

You can find a project home page at
https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/

OmegaT project uses a Gradle plugin to use launch4j during build process.
The plugin we use is found at
https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/edu.sc.seis.launch4j

There is a gradle task in launch4j group

- createAllExecutables

that will be automatically executed when `win` task selected.

### Inno Setup

We use `Inno Setup` to build an installer binary for Windows.
Inno Setup is a free installer builder for Windows programs by Jordan Russell
and Martijn Laan. First introduced in 1997, Inno Setup today rivals
and even surpasses many commercial installers in a feature set and stability.

We can download Inno Setup executable binary that can run on Windows.
It is also able to run with WINE on linux.

There is a docker image built with WINE and linux.

#### Install InnoSetup on Windows

When you want to build a Windows installer package on Windows10/11, you need to prepare InnoSetup6 installation
manually.
Please open your web browser and goto https://jsoftware.org/isdl.php
Select Stable Release `innosetup-6.2.2.exe`, download and install.

After successfully installed, you should go to https://github.com/jsoftware/issrc/tree/is-6_2_2
and click "Code" button on the page, then select "Download ZIP" link.
You will get downloaded zip file named `issrc-is-6_2_2.zip`.
Please open zip file and goto internal folder `Files/Langauges/Unofficial`, and then extract all `*.isl` files
into your InnoSetup installed folder, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup6\Languages\`.

At last, please open the control panel's Systems property and open `Environment Variable` edit dialog.
Add Inno Setup folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup6\`  in PATH environment variable.

### Build windows package on Linux

OmegaT CI/CD environment is on Ubuntu Linux 22.04.
Gradle tasks automatically check existence of `iscc` command, or container execution environment 
where there is `docker` command or `nerdctl` command.

### Gradle tasks

There are 6 tasks defined to assemble Windows installer.
When launch `win` task of gradle, it will launch all 6 tasks.

- winJRE
- winJRE64
- winNoJRE
- winJRESigned
- winJRE64Signed
- winNoJRESigned

To build singed executable binary installer, you need to have a signing tool and a certification
in your smartcard(HSM). You should configure your key id and passphrase in `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
You also need to install a smartcard reader driver in your system.

A configuration looks like 
```properties
#pkcs11engine=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engine-3/libpkcs11.so
pkcs11module=/usr/lib/libcrypto3PKCS.so
pkcs11cert=pkcs11:type=cert
winCodesignPassword=passphraseHere
winCodesignTimestampUrl=http://time.certum.pl/
```

OmegaT gradle build script is configured that you run a build process on Linux or Windows,
and you have installed `osslsigncode` utility in your Operating System.

Because of recent change of an operation policy by a certification authority consortium, 
certification is now provided a form of hardware security module (HSM) such as smartcard,
it is so difficult to sign code in container environment.

If anyone knows a way to do it with container, please tell us.


## Building macOS installer

OmegaT project provides zip-packages which have macOS framework folder structure with
application launcher binary. We use `AppBundler` that Sun Microsystems (currently Oracle)
released for java applications on macOS. 

We use a `gradle-appbundler-plugin` and configured to produce intell mac launcher and
M1/M2 mac launcher. `genMac` task is to configured to generate the launcher.

### build distribution

There are several tasks defined to assemble distributions for macOS.

#### basic distribution without signing

`armMacDiztZip` and `macDistCip` tasks are used to build standard distribution package.
if you launch `mac` task, you will get these 2 package files. 

#### signed package

OmegaT project prepares tasks to sign to packages for macOS.

- macSignedDistZip
- armMacSignedDistZip
- macStapledNotarizedDistZip
- armMacStapledNotarizedDistZip

#### Debug mac packages

It is convenient to use a following tasks to prepare a package directory
structure in a `build/install/` folder.

- installArmMacDist
- installMacDist

## Building distribution with Linux Java runtime

OmegaT has tasks to build a distribution with Java runtime for Linux OS.

- linux64DistTarBz
- linuxArm64DistTarBz

These tasks build `tar.bz2` distribution package with JRE.

## Java Runtime to bundle with

You need to put Java Runtime package in a directory `assetDir` property specified.
It is a parent directory of OmegaT project source in default.

Following packages are recognized as a windows JRE.

- OpenJDK17U-jre_x86-32_windows_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.zip
- OpenJDK17U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.zip

Following packages are recognized as a macOS JRE.

- OpenJDK17U-jre_aarch64_mac_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.tar.gz
- OpenJDK17U-jre_x64_mac_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.tar.gz

Following packages are recognized as a Linux JRE.

- OpenJDK17U-jre_aarch64_linux_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.tar.gz
- OpenJDK17U-jre_x64_linux_hotspot_17.0.8.1_1.tar.gz


## Building Linux native packages

OmegaT has tasks to generate Linux native packages in "DEB" and "RPM".
We use `jpackage` packaging tool which is added in a Java Development Kit.
It has been introduced from Java 14 and OmegaT project requires JDK 17.

The packaging tool `jpackage` generates installable packages for Java applications.
You can provide platform-specific packages for Linux, macOS and Windows to users
with a familiar way to install and launch your applications.

`jpackage` bundles java runtime which is used to run Gradle or is used to compile a project
that has `jpackage` utility. Because OmegaT project uses Java 11 to compile, you need to
run Gradle with JDK17.

OmegaT use `gradle-jpackage-plugin` that integrate `jpackage` command line utility
which is bundled in JDK with Gradle build utility.

You can use the following tasks to produce the packages.

- `linuxDebDist`
- `linuxRpmDist`

You can debug a content of the package, you can run a task `jpackage` that produce a
directory structure in `build/app-image/OmegaT/`.

### Directory structure inside package

A directory hierarchy inside package is a bit different with standard
zip distributions, which is conformance with the Linux Standard Base.

For example of deb package, when installing the package you will observe;

```text
/opt/omegat-org/omegat/
                  |- bin/OmegaT   (launcher exe)
                  |- share/doc/license
                  |- lib/
                       |- app/ (*.jar)
                       |- docs/ (readme, manuals)
                       |- images/
                       |- modules/
                       |- runtime/  (JRE)
                       |- scripts/
                       libapplauncher.so
                       OmegaT.png  
```
