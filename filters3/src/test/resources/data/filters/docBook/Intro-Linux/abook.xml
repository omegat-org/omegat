            <title>Why this guide?</title>
            <para>Many people still believe that learning Linux is difficult, or that only experts
                can understand how a Linux system works. Though there is a lot of free documentation
                available, the documentation is widely scattered on the Web, and often confusing,
                since it is usually oriented toward experienced UNIX or Linux users. Today, thanks
                to the advancements in development, Linux has grown in popularity both at home and
                at work. The goal of this guide is to show people of all ages that Linux can be
                simple and fun, and used for all kinds of purposes.</para>

        <section id="intro_02">
            <title>Who should read this book?</title>
            <para> This guide was created as an overview of the Linux Operating System, geared
                toward new users as an exploration tour and getting started guide, with exercises at
                the end of each chapter. For more advanced trainees it can be a desktop reference,
                and a collection of the base knowledge needed to proceed with system and network
                administration. This book contains many real life examples derived from the author's
                experience as a Linux system and network administrator, trainer and consultant. We
                hope these examples will help you to get a better understanding of the Linux system
                and that you feel encouraged to try out things on your own.</para>
            <para>Everybody who wants to get a <quote>CLUE</quote>, a Command Line User Experience,
                with Linux (and UNIX in general) will find this book useful.</para>

            <para> Many thanks to all the people who shared their experiences. And especially to the
                Belgian Linux users for hearing me out every day and always
                being generous in their comments.</para>
            <para>Also a special thought for Tabatha Marshall for doing a really thorough revision,
                spell check and styling, and to Eugene Crosser for spotting the errors that we two
                overlooked.</para>
            <para>And thanks to all the readers who notified me about missing topics and who helped
                to pick out the last errors, unclear definitions and typos by going through the
                trouble of mailing me all their remarks. These are also the people who help me keep
                this guide up to date, like Filipus Klutiero who did a complete review in 2005 and 2006 and helps me getting the guide into the Debian docs collection, and Alexey Eremenko who sent me the foundation for chapter 11.</para>
<para>In 2006, Suresh Rajashekara created a Debian package of this documentation.</para>
            <para>Finally, a big thank you for the volunteers who are currently translating this
                document in French, Swedish, German, Farsi, Hindi and more. It is a big work that should
                not be underestimated; I admire your courage.</para>

            <title>What do you need?</title>
            <para>You will require a computer and a medium containing a Linux distribution. Most of
                this guide applies to all Linux distributions - and UNIX in general. Apart from
                time, there are no further specific requirements.</para>
            <para>The <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO/"> Installation
                HOWTO</ulink> contains helpful information on how to obtain Linux software and
                install it on your computer. Hardware requirements and coexistence with other
                operating systems are also discussed.</para>
            <para>CD images can be downloaded from <ulink url="http://www.linux-iso.com/">
                linux-iso.com</ulink> and many other locations, see <xref linkend="app1"/>.</para>
            <para>An interesting alternative for those who don't dare to take the step of an actual
                Linux installation on their machine are the Linux distributions that you can run
                from a CD, such as the <ulink url="http://www.knoppix.com/"> Knoppix</ulink> distribution.</para>

            <title>Organization of this document</title>
            <para>This guide is part of the Linux Documentation Project and aims to be the foundation for all other materials that you can get from
                the Project. As such, it provides you with the fundamental
                knowledge needed by anyone who wants to start working with a Linux system, while at
                the same time it tries to consciously avoid re-inventing the hot water. Thus, you
                can expect this book to be incomplete and full of links to sources of additional
                information on your system, on the Internet and in your system documentation.</para>
            <para>The first chapter is an introduction to the subject on Linux; the next two discuss
                absolute basic commands. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss some more advanced but still basic
                topics. Chapter 6 is needed for continuing with the rest, since it discusses editing
                files, an ability you need to pass from Linux newbie to Linux user. The following
                chapters discuss somewhat more advanced topics that you will have to deal with in
                everyday Linux use.</para>
            <para>All chapters come with exercises that will test your preparedness for the next chapter.</para>
