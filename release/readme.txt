Licensing information
=====================

OmegaT is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version. You can find the text of the license in
/docs/OmegaT-license.txt.

OmegaT uses a number of librairies. The license of each library is mentioned in
/lib/licenses/Licenses.txt.



Prerequisites for installing OmegaT
===================================

OmegaT requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or higher to be
installed on your system.

We recommend using OmegaT packages that include the JRE, to save you the trouble
of selecting, obtaining and installing it.



Installing OmegaT (Windows)
===========================

Launch the installation program.



Installing OmegaT (Mac)
=======================

Unpack the OmegaT .zip archive to obtain a folder that contains a documentation
file and the OmegaT application. Move the folder to an appropriate location such
as the Applications folder.



Installing OmegaT (Linux)
=========================

Place the archive in any suitable folder and unpack it. OmegaT is then ready to
be launched.

You can however obtain a neater and more user-friendly installation by using the
installation script (linux-install.sh). To use this script, open a terminal
window (console), change folder to the folder containing OmegaT.jar and the
linux-install.sh script, and execute the script with ./linux-install.sh.



Installing OmegaT (Solaris, FreeBSD, etc.)
=========================================

Place the archive in any suitable folder and unpack it. OmegaT is then ready to
be launched.



Launching OmegaT (Windows)
==========================

If, during installation, you have created a shortcut on the desktop,
double-click on that shortcut.

The installer can create shortcuts for you in the start menu, on the desktop and
in the quick launch area. You can also manually drag the file OmegaT.exe to the
start menu, the desktop or the quick launch area to link it from there.

If you can see the file OmegaT but not OmegaT.exe in your File Manager (Windows
Explorer), change the settings so that file extensions are displayed.



Launching OmegaT (Mac)
======================

Double-click on the OmegaT application.

You may drag the OmegaT application to your dock or to the toolbar of a Finder
window to be able to launch it from any location. You can also launch it from
the Spotlight search field.



Launching OmegaT (Linux)
========================

If you used linux-install.sh script, you should be able to launch OmegaT with:

    Alt+F2

and then:

    omegat

For a more user-friendly way of launching OmegaT, you can use the Kaptain script
provided (omegat.kaptn). To use this script you must first install Kaptain. You
can then launch the Kaptain launch script with:

    Alt+F2

and then:

    omegat.kaptn



Launching OmegaT from the command line (all systems)
====================================================

The command to launch OmegaT is:

    cd <folder where the file OmegaT.jar is located>

    <name and path of the Java executable file> -jar OmegaT.jar

(The Java executable file is the file java on Linux and java.exe on Windows.  If
Java is installed at system level and is in the command path, the full path need
not be entered.)
