/**
 * Interface for dictionary access.
 * <p>
 * Each dictionary format reader should implement this interface. Each instance
 * of this interface represents one dictionary.
 * <p>
 * Implementers are encouraged to use {@link DictionaryData} to store their
 * data. A simple implementation can just load its entire data at once, but we
 * don't recommend it because it's very memory-intensive.
 * <p>
 * Instead we recommend that you read the dictionary's index (article titles)
 * and store some short data, like article offsets into the dictionary file, as
 * the value. In your implementation of the <code>readArticles*</code> methods
 * you can use these offsets to actually load the content from disk. The OS will
 * cache dictionary file against slow access.
 * <p>
 * See {@link StarDict} for an example of the recommended deferred-loading
 * implementation, and {@link LingvoDSL} for an example of an simpler, up-front
 * loading implementation.
