/**
 * Class to compute Levenshtein Distance.
 *
 * <p>
 * Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two strings,
 * which we will refer to as the source string (s) and the target string (t).
 * The distance is the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions
 * required to transform s into t.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * <ul>
 * <li>If s is "test" and t is "test", then LD(s,t) = 0, because no
 * transformations are needed. The strings are already identical.
 * <li>If s is "test" and t is "tent", then LD(s,t) = 1, because one
 * substitution (change "s" to "n") is sufficient to transform s into t.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The greater the Levenshtein distance, the more different the strings are.
 * <p>
 * Levenshtein distance is named after the Russian scientist Vladimir
 * Levenshtein, who devised the algorithm in 1965. If you can't spell or
 * pronounce Levenshtein, the metric is also sometimes called edit distance.
 *
 * alex73's comment: We can't make 'compute' mathod static, because in this case
 * LevenshteinDistance will not be thread-safe(see 'd' and 'p' arrays). We can't
 * create these arrays inside 'compute' method, because it's enough slow
 * operation. We have to create LevenshteinDistance instance one for each thread
 * where we will call it. It's best way for best performance.
 *

     * Compute Levenshtein distance between two lists.
     *
     * <p> The difference between this impl. and the canonical one is that,
     * rather than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1 by
     * t.length()+1, we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length
     * s.length()+1.
     *
     * <p> The first, d, is the 'current working' distance array that maintains
     * the newest distance cost counts as we iterate through the characters of
     * String s. Each time we increment the index of String t we are comparing,
     * d is copied to p, the second int[]. Doing so allows us to retain the
     * previous cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking the minimum of
     * the cost count to the left, up one, and diagonally up and to the left of
     * the current cost count being calculated). <p> (Note that the arrays
     * aren't really copied anymore, just switched... this is clearly much
     * better than cloning an array or doing a System.arraycopy() each time
     * through the outer loop.)
     *
     * <p> Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is this
     * one does not cause an out of memory condition when calculating the LD
     * over two very large strings.
     *
     * <p> For perfomance reasons the maximal number of compared items is {@link
     * #MAX_N}.
