 * Aggregated Tag is a compound tag made up of other tags. The purpose of this
 * class is reducing the number of tags shown in OpenXML documents. The current
 * OpenXML filter finds too many tags, usually causing what users call the
 * "tag soup". Tags aggregation can help alleviate this problem, but can
 * sometimes lead to semantic issues. Aggregation is OK only as a temporary
 * hack, until we improve the OpenXML filter.
