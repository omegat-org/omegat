/**
 * A base bridge implementation that handles errors thrown by subclasses.
 * <p>
 * If the subclass throws an exception, the bridge will log the exception and
 * then simply return empty results from then on. This is OK because the bridge
 * is recreated on project load, so in the case of temporary issues the user can
 * just reload the project to restore functionality.
 * <p>
 * This failsafe is required because LanguageTool checks are called
 * automatically and in large batches, so if an exception is thrown it will
 * likely be thrown repeatedly for all invocations. Especially in the case of
 * the network bridge we would otherwise spam the remote server or even DDoS it.
