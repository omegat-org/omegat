# Variety of Contribution

## The OmegaT Project Philosophy

OmegaT is a free and open-source software (FOSS) project. This means that not only is the application available at no
cost, but its source code is also publicly accessible. Users are free to use, share, and modify the program.

This freedom is central to our philosophy. We believe the ability to change the program to fit one's own needs is
essential â€” this is often referred to as *"free as in speech"*, as opposed to *"free as in beer"*.

In the same spirit, anyone is welcome (though not obligated) to contribute to the OmegaT project in various ways.

## Documentation

Anyone can contribute to OmegaT's documentation, whether by writing a user manual, creating tutorial videos, or
improving the existing help files. If the material is useful, the OmegaT team will gladly share it with the broader user
community.

We value contributions of all types â€” not just code.

## Localization

Localization (L10N) of the application and documentation is an active area of contribution. If you'd like to help
translate OmegaT into your language, we invite you to join the OmegaT-L10N project on GitHub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N](https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N)

Details about how to get involved are provided in the Localization section of this guide.

## Adoption of Contributions

While everyone is free to propose changes, only those considered beneficial to users will be adopted into the official
OmegaT release. This ensures the integrity of the project and has earned OmegaT the Softpedia "100% FREE" guarantee.

## Communication Channels

OmegaT is developed by volunteers. Contributions are made based on the interests and motivations of the individual
contributors â€” a model we sometimes call _delegated anarchy_.

There are several ways to share ideas and collaborate:

- **User Support Mailing List**  
  New and experienced users can ask questions and suggest improvements. This is the main hub for user interaction.

- **Developers Mailing List**  
  For technical discussions and deeper collaboration, developers are encouraged to use this list.

- **Issue Tracker**  
  Once an idea is ready for consideration, you can submit a feature request (RFE: Request for Feature Enhancement). Many
  RFEs have been implemented â€” some immediately, others when a developer found the time and interest to implement them.

## Plugins

OmegaT supports plugins, which allow you to extend its functionality without modifying the core program. If you'd like
to add a new feature that may also benefit others, writing a plugin is a great way to start.

Plugin categories include:

- User interface themes
- File filters
- Dictionary connectors
- Machine translation connectors
- And more

Even many built-in features are implemented as plugins, so you can learn by example. For plugin development, see the
relevant section in this guide.

## Scripting

OmegaT also supports automation using scripts. Scripts can be triggered by certain events, and can be written in Groovy
or JavaScript. This is useful for customizing workflows or extending OmegaT's capabilities in lightweight ways.
