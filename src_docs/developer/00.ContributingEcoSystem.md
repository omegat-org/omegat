# Variety of Contribution

## The OmegaT Project Philosophy

OmegaT is a free, libre, and open-source software (FLOSS) project. This means that:
- You can download and use it at no cost
- You can see and modify the source code
- You can share the program with others

OmegaT uses the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL-3), which gives you the freedom to:
- Use the program for any purpose
- Study and change the program to suit your needs
- Share the program with friends and colleagues
- Share your improvements with others

These freedoms are central to the OmegaT philosophy.

We believe software should work for you, not the other way around.
You should be able to adapt it to your needs, which is why we make the source code available to everyone.

In this spirit, we welcome anyone who wants to contribute to OmegaT in whatever way they can.
There's no obligation to contribute, but if you'd like to help, there are many ways to do so.

## Documentation

Anyone can contribute to OmegaT's documentation, whether by writing a user manual, creating tutorial videos, or improving the existing help files. If the material is useful, the OmegaT team will gladly share it with the broader user community.

We value contributions of all types â€” not just code.

## Localization

Localization (L10N) of the application and documentation is an active area of contribution. If you'd like to help translate OmegaT into your language, we invite you to join the OmegaT-L10N project on GitHub:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N](https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N)

Details about how to get involved are provided in the Localization section of this guide.

## Adoption of Contributions

Everyone is welcome to suggest changes to OmegaT. The project team reviews these suggestions and includes those that benefit most users in the official releases. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of OmegaT.

Even if your suggestion isn't included in the official release, remember that you can still modify your own copy of OmegaT or share your modified version with others (following the GPL-3 license terms).
This flexibility is one of the great benefits of open-source software.

## Communication Channels

OmegaT is developed by volunteers who contribute based on their interests and skills.
Everyone works on what they find most interesting or important.

Here's how you can connect with the community:

- **User Support Mailing List**  
  A friendly place where both new and experienced users can ask questions and suggest improvements.  
  â†’ [Search/Subscribe the list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/lists/omegat-users)
- Don't be shy - this is the main place for getting help and sharing ideas.

- **Developers Mailing List**  
  For discussions about code and technical aspects of OmegaT.
    â†’ [Search/Subscribe the list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/lists/omegat-development)
- If you're interested in the programming side of things, this is the place to join.

- **Issue Tracker**  
  Where you can report bugs or suggest new features (called RFEs: Requests for Feature Enhancement).
    â†’ [Search/Record the issue](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/_list/tickets)
Many feature requests have been implemented, sometimes right away, sometimes when a developer becomes interested in working on them.

## Plugins

OmegaT supports plugins, which are add-ons that extend what the program can do without changing its core.
This makes it easy to customize OmegaT to fit your specific needs.

If you have an idea for a new feature, creating a plugin is a great way to bring it to life.
It's also a good first step for new contributors since you can work on your own piece without needing to understand the entire codebase.

Plugins can add or modify many aspects of OmegaT, including:

- User interface themes
- File filters (to support additional file formats)
- Dictionary connectors
- Machine translation services
- And much more

Many of OmegaT's built-in features are actually implemented as plugins, so you can learn by looking at these examples.
For details on how to develop plugins, see the relevant section in this guide.

## Scripting

OmegaT also supports automation through scripts. Scripts are small programs that can perform tasks automatically when certain events happen in OmegaT. You can write scripts in Groovy or JavaScript.

Scripting is a powerful way to customize how OmegaT works for you. For example, you could create a script that:
- Automatically formats text in a specific way
- Performs custom quality checks on your translations
- Connects to external tools or services

Even if you're new to programming, scripting can be a good way to start contributing, as scripts are typically smaller and more focused than other code contributions.
