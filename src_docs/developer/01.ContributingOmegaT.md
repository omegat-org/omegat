# Contributing to OmegaT Development

OmegaT is developed by a global team of volunteers. If you're interested in improving the code, fixing bugs, or adding
new features ‚Äî you're more than welcome to join us!

The main development takes place in the `master` branch of our Git repository:  
üëâ [https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat](https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat)

Whether you're just getting started or already familiar with Git and Java, this guide will help you make your first
contribution.

## Step-by-Step: How to Contribute

### 1. Start a Conversation

üì¨ [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-development](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-development)

This gives everyone a chance to understand your idea, give feedback, or suggest alternatives.
