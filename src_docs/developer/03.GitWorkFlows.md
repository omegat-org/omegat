# Git workflows

OmegaT project uses `git` distributed source code management (SCM) system.
Developers, document writers are recommended to know specific workflow and basic
operations on git repository.

## Rebase and merge strategy

## The repository

We use GitHub `github.com/omegat-org/omegat` for our repository.

## Topic branch

We take a specific topic branch name, like '`topic/<username>/<component>/what-you-want-to-realize-a-feature`'.

Bad branch name is as follows;

- '`change`'
- '`fix`'
- '`my-patch-1`'
- '`docs`'

## Check your change

Before creating Pull-Request, you are recommended to check your changes.
We have a custom gradle task to check which files are changed on topic branch.

You can run the utility through `omegat workflow` task group of IDE's Gradle tasks menu
and click `changeOnBranch`.
Otherwise, you can run it on terminal `./gradlew changeOnBranch`

## Code formatting

Before pushing your change to the project, you are recommended to use `spotless` utility
to format your code automatically.

You can run spotless only on your changes through `omegat workflow` task group of IDE's Gradle tasks menu
and click `spotlessChangedApply`.
Otherwise, you can run it on terminal `./gradlew spotlessChangedApply`
