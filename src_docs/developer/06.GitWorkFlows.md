# Git Workflow

If you’re planning to contribute to OmegaT — whether it’s code, documentation, or translation — we’re happy to have you on board!

We use Git as our version control system, and our project is hosted on GitHub:  
👉 https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat

This guide walks you through how to contribute using Git and GitHub, even if you’re new to them.

Git documentation:
https://git-scm.com/docs

GitHub documentation:

## Where Development Happens

The main development takes place in the `master` branch of the repository.  
When working on a contribution, **create a separate branch** from `master`. This is called a **topic branch**.

---

## ✅ Good Branch Naming

Use the following format for naming your topic branch:

`topic/your-username/area/short-description`

**Examples:**

- `topic/charlotte/editorpane/fix-keybindings`
- `topic/philippe/docs/add-plugin-guide`

Clear naming makes it easier for everyone to understand your work at a glance.

Avoid names like:

- `fix`
- `patch-1`
- `change`
- `my-branch`

Such names do not give any indication of what your work is about.

## Clone the OmegaT code on your machine

### If you work with Git

1. **Clone the OmegaT repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omegat.git
   cd omegat
```

2. **Create your topic branch:**

```bash
   git branch topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

3. **Switch to your topic branch:**

```bash
   git switch topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

### If you work with Github

1. **Fork the OmegaT repository**  
   Visit: https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat
   Click the “Fork” button in the top right.

2. **Clone your fork:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omegat.git
   cd omegat
```

3. **Add the main repository as an upstream:**

```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat.git
```

4. **Create your topic branch:**

```bash
   git branch topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

5. **Switch to your topic branch:**

```bash
   git switch topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

## ✅ Before submitting your code

### 🔍 Check What You Changed

Use our custom Gradle task to check which files you’ve modified.

**In your IDE:**

- Open the Gradle Tasks panel
- Expand `omegat workflow`
- Run `changeOnBranch`

**From the terminal:**

- Run `./gradlew changeOnBranch`

---

### 🎨 Format Your Code

Use Spotless to automatically format only your changes.

**In your IDE:**

- Open the Gradle Tasks panel
- Expand `omegat workflow`
- Run `spotlessChangedApply`

**From the terminal:**

- Run `./gradlew spotlessChangedApply`

This ensures your code follows the project’s style and avoids noisy diffs.

---

## 📬 Submit Your Code

### If you work with Git only

1. **Create a Git patch for your code:**

```bash
   git diff
```

2. **Attach the patch to the relevant issue on Sourceforge:**

You are supposed to work on an issue that you either responded to or registered yourself on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/_list/tickets).

3. **Inform the development list that you sent a patch:**

You’re supposed to have discussed your code on the [development list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/lists/omegat-development) before starting to write, so use the same thread.

### If you work with Github

1. **Push your topic branch to GitHub:**

```bash
   git push origin topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

2. **Open a Pull Request:**

  - Visit your fork on GitHub
  - Click “Compare & pull request”
  - Add a clear title and explanation
  - Link to any related issues or discussions

Tip: You can open a **draft pull request** if you’re still working on it but want feedback early.

---

## ✅ After You Open a Pull Request

Once you submit a pull request (PR), GitHub will automatically run our Continuous Integration (CI) checks.

These checks ensure that your contribution builds successfully and follows the project's standards. If something goes wrong, GitHub will show it — but **you need to check it yourself** and make any necessary fixes.

---

### 📋 Where to Check the CI Results

After opening a PR:

1. Scroll down to the **Checks** section (below the PR description).
2. Click the **“Details”** link next to any failed check, such as:
   - `Quality checks`
   - `SpotBugs`
   - `PMD`
   - `checkStyle`
   - `Acceptance Test`
3. GitHub will open a log page that shows:
   - What failed
   - On which file and line
   - Sometimes with inline annotations

---

### ⚠️ What to Look For

| Check Name        | What It Means                          | Common Fix                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Quality Checks`  | Tests and checks are failed            | It send Gradle Scan(R) to web site. You can open details in Gradle Velocity |
| `SpotBugs`        | Logic uses wrong habit                 | Run `./gradlew spotbugsMain spotbugsTest` and fix issues                    |
| `PMD`             | Out of the coding best practice        | Change your code according to the annotated suggestions                     |
| `checkStyle`      | Code violates style rules (Checkstyle) | Run `./gradlew checkStyleMain checkStyleTest` and fix issues                |
| `Acceptance test` | Acceptance tests failed                | Run `./gradlww testAcceptance` and fix issues                               |

---

### 🛠 Fixing the Issues

If the CI check failed, **you are expected to fix the problem yourself.**

Do not wait for someone to tell you what to do. Use these steps:

1. Read the error message.
2. Open the file and line number referenced.
3. Reproduce the issue locally:

```bash
# Build and test
./gradlew build

# Run Checkstyle
./gradlew checkStyleMain checkStyleTest
```

4. Fix the issue.
5. Recommit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix checkstyle | spotbugs | unit test errors"
git push
```

Pushing a new commit will automatically rerun the checks.

---

### ✨ Code Formatting: Do This Every Time

Before committing your changes, **run this** to auto-format your modified files:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessChangedApply
```

This prevents many common CI failures and makes the code easier to review.  
You can also set up automatic formatting in your IDE using the project's Spotless rules.

---

### 🔁 Re-running CI Manually

If a CI check fails for unrelated reasons (e.g. flaky network or timeout):

1. Go to the **Checks** tab of your pull request.
2. Click **“Re-run jobs”** > **“Re-run all jobs”** or **“Re-run failed jobs”**.

---

### ✏️ Why This Matters

CI checks **are not optional.** If your PR fails them:

* It will **not** be reviewed until all checks pass.
* Reviewers are **not responsible** for fixing your code.
* Ignoring CI feedback delays your contribution and others'.

Learning to understand CI is part of modern software development — and it’s a required skill for contributing to OmegaT.

### ❤️ Still Need Help?

If you’ve tried but are stuck:

1. **Copy the exact error message**
2. **Say what you did** to try to fix it
3. Ask clearly on the [developer mailing list](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-development)

We’ll be glad to help — if you show that you've made an effort first.
