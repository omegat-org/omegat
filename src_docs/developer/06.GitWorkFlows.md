# Git Workflow

If you’re planning to contribute to OmegaT — whether it’s code, documentation, or translation — we’re happy to have you on board!

We use Git as our version control system, and our project is hosted on GitHub:  
👉 https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat

This guide walks you through how to contribute using Git and GitHub, even if you’re new to them.

---

## Where Development Happens

The main development takes place in the `master` branch of the repository.  
When working on a contribution, **create a separate branch** from `master`. This is called a **topic branch**.

---

## ✅ Good Branch Naming

Use the following format for naming your topic branch:

`topic/your-username/area/short-description`

**Examples:**

- `topic/charlotte/editorpane/fix-keybindings`
- `topic/philippe/docs/add-plugin-guide`

Clear naming makes it easier for everyone to understand your work at a glance.

Avoid names like:

- `fix`
- `patch-1`
- `change`
- `my-branch`

Such names do not give any indication of what your work is about.

## Clone the OmegaT code on your machine

### If you work with Git

1. **Clone the OmegaT repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omegat.git
   cd omegat
```

2. **Create your topic branch:**

```bash
   git checkout -b topic/your-username/area/short-description
```   
 

### If you work with Github

1. **Fork the OmegaT repository**  
   Visit: https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat  
   Click the “Fork” button in the top right.

2. **Clone your fork:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omegat.git
   cd omegat
```

3. **Add the main repository as an upstream:**

```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat.git
```

4. **Create your topic branch:**

```bash
   git checkout -b topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

## ✅ Before submitting your code

### 🔍 Check What You Changed

Use our custom Gradle task to check which files you’ve modified.

**In your IDE:**

- Open the Gradle Tasks panel
- Expand `omegat workflow`
- Run `changeOnBranch`

**From the terminal:**

- Run `./gradlew changeOnBranch`

---

### 🎨 Format Your Code

Use Spotless to automatically format only your changes.

**In your IDE:**

- Open the Gradle Tasks panel
- Expand `omegat workflow`
- Run `spotlessChangedApply`

**From the terminal:**

- Run `./gradlew spotlessChangedApply`

This ensures your code follows the project’s style and avoids noisy diffs.

---

## 📬 Submit Your Code

### If you work with Git only

1. **Create a Git patch for your code:**

```bash
   git diff
```

2. **Attach the patch to the relevant issue on Sourceforge:**

You are supposed to work on an issue that you either responded to or registered yourself on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/_list/tickets).

3. **Inform the development list that you sent a patch:**

You’re supposed to have discussed your code on the [development list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/lists/omegat-development) before starting to write, so use the same thread.

### If you work with Github

1. **Push your topic branch to GitHub:**

```bash
   git push origin topic/your-username/area/short-description
```

2. **Open a Pull Request:**

  - Visit your fork on GitHub
  - Click “Compare & pull request”
  - Add a clear title and explanation
  - Link to any related issues or discussions

Tip: You can open a **draft pull request** if you’re still working on it but want feedback early.
