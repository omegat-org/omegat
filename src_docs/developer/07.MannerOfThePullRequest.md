# Manner of the Pull Request

## Making Effective Comments on Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are not just about submitting code — they are also a space for discussion and collaboration. Writing clear, relevant, and respectful comments is essential to keep development productive and enjoyable for everyone.

This section is especially helpful for project managers, testers, and new contributors who want to provide feedback but are unsure how to do it effectively.

### 🎯 Stay Focused on the Scope

Each PR typically aims to fix a specific problem or introduce a clearly defined feature. When reviewing a PR, please:

- **Read the PR description** carefully. It explains the purpose and scope.
- **Comment only on things directly related** to that purpose.
- If you discover an unrelated issue, note it down elsewhere (e.g., in a new ticket or in a chat), rather than posting it in the PR.

> 📌 *Example: If the PR is fixing a spellchecker bug, avoid posting logs about an unrelated crash in the Machine Translation plugin.*

### 🧪 How to Report Testing Results

If you're testing a PR and something doesn't work as expected:

1. **First, confirm** whether the issue is part of the scope.
2. **Describe clearly** what you did, what happened, and what you expected.
3. **Avoid posting raw logs** unless they are directly related and help reproduce the problem.

> 🙋‍♀️ Instead of:  
> *"Here's a huge log dump I found — not sure if it's related."*
>
> ✅ Try this:  
> *"When I tested the new caching feature with glossary lookup, I noticed that the refresh button didn't seem to respond. Is that expected?"*

### 💬 Constructive Review Comments

When reviewing the code itself (even if you're not a programmer), you can still help by:

- Asking for clarification when something is unclear.
- Noting typos, confusing wording, or behavior differences.
- Suggesting improvement *with context*, not just pointing out flaws.

> ❌ Avoid:  
> "This doesn't work."
>
> ✅ Prefer:  
> "I expected the text to auto-save after editing, but it didn't. Is this part of the feature or a known limitation?"

### 🤝 Respect Roles and Expertise

In small open-source teams, it's common for one person to wear many hats — a developer, tester, reviewer, and even
project manager. Still:

- **Let the PR author respond first** to comments or questions.
- **Give the reviewer space** to evaluate the code’s quality and integration.
- **Avoid interrupting the review** with unrelated findings.

This helps reduce confusion and avoids discouraging contributors who are generously offering their time and skill.

### ✅ Summary

When commenting on PRs:

| DO ✅                             | DON'T ❌                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Stay within the PR’s scope       | Post unrelated issues or logs      |
| Write clear, respectful feedback | Make vague or accusatory remarks   |
| Report test results clearly      | Dump full logs without explanation |
| Let the PR author reply          | Hijack the discussion              |
