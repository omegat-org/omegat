# Manner of the Pull Request

## Making Effective Comments on Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are not just about submitting code — they are also a space for discussion and collaboration. Writing clear, relevant, and respectful comments is essential to keep development productive and enjoyable for everyone.

This section is especially helpful for project managers, testers, and new contributors who want to provide feedback but are unsure how to do it effectively.

### 🎯 Stay Focused on the Scope

Each PR typically aims to fix a specific problem or introduce a clearly defined feature. When reviewing a PR, please:

- **Read the PR description** carefully. It explains the purpose and scope.
- **Comment only on things directly related** to that purpose.
- If you discover an unrelated issue, note it down elsewhere (e.g., in a new issue ticket or in a development mail list), rather than posting it in the PR.
- Even if an idea feels related because it came up while reading the PR, if it’s not directly part of the change being discussed, please keep it separate by opening a new issue or starting a new discussion.

> 📌 *Example: If the PR is fixing a spellchecker bug, avoid posting logs about an unrelated crash in the Machine Translation plugin.*

### 🧪 How to Report Testing Results

If you're testing a PR and something doesn't work as expected:

1. **First, confirm** whether the issue is part of the scope.
2. **Describe clearly** what you did, what happened, and what you expected.
3. **Avoid posting raw logs** unless they are directly related and help reproduce the problem.

> 🙋‍♀️ Instead of:  
> *"Here's a huge log dump I found — not sure if it's related."*
>
> ✅ Try this:  
> *"When I tested the new caching feature with glossary lookup, I noticed that the refresh button didn't seem to respond. Is that expected?"*

### 💬 Constructive Review Comments

When reviewing the code itself (even if you're not a programmer), you can still help by:

- Asking for clarification when something is unclear.
- Noting typos, confusing wording, or behavior differences.
- Suggesting improvement *with context*, not just pointing out flaws.

> ❌ Avoid:  
> "This doesn't work."
>
> ✅ Prefer:  
> "I expected the text to auto-save after editing, but it didn't. Is this part of the feature or a known limitation?"

### 🤝 Respect Roles and Expertise

In small open-source teams, it's common for one person to wear many hats — a developer, tester, reviewer, and even
project manager. Still:

- **Let the PR author respond first** to comments or questions.
- **Give the reviewer space** to evaluate the code's quality and integration.
- **Avoid interrupting the review** with unrelated findings.

This helps reduce confusion and avoids discouraging contributors who are generously offering their time and skill.

### 🔄 Keep Development Moving — Don’t Block the Flow

Sometimes, reviewers suggest improvements like "please write better docs" or "can you update this part later?" These are helpful, but only if followed through. If the person making the suggestion doesn’t act — or if the contributor isn’t clear on what to do — progress stalls.

To keep development flowing:

- **Avoid vague promises.** If you suggest something, be ready to follow up or clearly hand off the task.
- **Support contributors.** If someone hesitates or is unsure, help them succeed — not stall.
- **Don’t “park” the PR** by saying "I'll write it later" and then forgetting.

> 🤝 A good reviewer helps motivate contributors and keeps energy moving forward. Be someone who builds momentum, not someone who blocks it.
