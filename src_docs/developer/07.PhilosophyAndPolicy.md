# Project Philosophy and Policy

OmegaT is a free and open-source computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool developed by and for professional translators.
The philosophy of the OmegaT project reflects the core values of the free software movement and the spirit of collaborative contribution.

## Freedom and Accessibility

OmegaT is released under a free software license (GNU GPL), which not only allows users to use the software free of charge, but also grants the freedom to copy, share, and modify it.
This kind of freedom â€” *"free as in speech"* rather than *"free as in beer"* â€” is central to the open-source philosophy.
Users are empowered to adapt the software to suit their specific needs.

We also believe that high-quality translation tools should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial means or location.

## Open and Volunteer-Driven

Volunteers carry out development of OmegaT.
Anyone is welcome to contribute, whether by improving the code, writing documentation, reporting issues, creating educational materials, or helping with translations.
There is no single way to contributeâ€”contributors are encouraged to take initiative and shape their involvement.

OmegaT uses a flexible and open style of collaboration.
Contributors are trusted to choose what they want to work on, based on their skills and interests.
There is no strict management or assigned tasks.

Project core members help set the overall direction and provide guidance when needed, but they do not control or assign daily work.
Everyone is welcome to take initiative, suggest ideas, and contribute in their own way.

## Translator-Centric Development

Unlike many commercial CAT tools, OmegaT is developed with translators, by translators.
Features are prioritized based on real-world use cases provided by our user community.
We emphasize workflows that benefit translators, not management systems or proprietary services.

## Contribution Guidelines

While contributions are welcome, all proposed changes â€” especially those involving source code â€” are reviewed by the development team to ensure they benefit OmegaTâ€™s user community.
Contributors are encouraged to follow best practices as outlined in the [Contributing to OmegaT](https://omegat.readthedocs.io/) guide to streamline the review process.

OmegaT has a long-standing commitment to maintaining software that is 100% free, without hidden costs or commercial lock-in.
This policy has earned the project recognition, including the Softpedia "100% FREE" guarantee.

## Collaborative Evolution

The future of OmegaT is shaped by its users. Feature suggestions and enhancement ideas can be submitted through an established process known as an RFE (Request for Feature Enhancement).
While not all suggestions can be implemented, many have been adopted thanks to active community participation.

Feature requests are more likely to be accepted if:
- They clearly benefit a broad range of users
- A developer volunteers to implement them
- In some cases, the requester funds the development

Sponsoring development is a valid and welcomed way to contribute.
If you're interested in funding a specific feature, the development team can provide an estimate and discuss its feasibility.

## Simplicity and Modularity

We aim for a clean, sustainable codebase with modular architecture.
New functionality is often implemented as optional plugins.
This keeps the core lightweight and flexible.
This also empowers contributors to experiment with new features without bloating the main application.

## Minimal Dependence on Proprietary Services

OmegaT avoids reliance on cloud-based or commercial services unless strictly optional.
Users should not be required to register or log in to any third-party system to use the core functionalities of the application.
We are encouraging developers to use GitHub to propose changes and collaborate on the project, but if you don't want to use GitHub,
you can still contribute by submitting issues and patches.

## A Shared Endeavor

OmegaT is more than just software â€” it is a community-driven initiative rooted in openness, transparency, and mutual respect.
Whether you are a translator, developer, writer, or advocate, your contributions help shape the ongoing evolution of OmegaT.
While OmegaT may not replicate all features of commercial tools, we are committed to gradual, thoughtful improvement.
Our roadmap is shaped by user feedback, technical feasibility, and adherence to our core principles.

We invite you to be part of this journey.
