# Building OmegaT

OmegaT is built with Gradle. Run `gradlew tasks` from the top level to see the
available tasks. Run `gradlew build` to build all possible distfiles and run the
main tests. Tasks skipped due to missing requirements will be noted in the
output.

OmegaT will run on the latest Java, but is required to be compatible with Java 11.

Eclipse and NetBeans are recommended IDEs for working with OmegaT source
code. NetBeans is required to modify *.form-based GUI layouts (install the
Gradle Support plugin to open the OmegaT project in NetBeans.)

Check the other files in this directory for documentation. You can
produce Javadoc by running `gradlew javadoc`, or browse online:

  [https://omegat.sourceforge.io/javadoc-latest/](https://omegat.sourceforge.io/javadoc-latest/)

## Prerequisite

As of Dec. 2023, here are the requirements to build OmegaT binaries;

1. Java Development kit 11 or later. When you want to build 
   a Linux deb/rpm package, JDK 17 or later is required.
2. Requires `docker` or `nerdctl` command to launch containerized processes.
   Build process for windows packages will be skipped when neither `docker` nor `nerdctl` command is not found. 
3. JDK 21 has not been supported yet to launch Gradle build tool,
   but it works well as an OmegaT runtime.

## Configuring Build Tasks

Some build tasks, such as signed installers, require additional configuration
via a `local.properties` file placed at the root of the source tree. See
`local.properties.example`.

When specified a Gradle property `forceSkipDocumentBuild`, the build task 
will skip build processes to generate greeting documents, `FirstStep.html`
in languages, and bundled manuals. You can edit `local.properties` or

## Build Assets

Some build tasks require the user to supply additional files not included in the
OmegaT source. These files should be placed in the assets directory, which by
default is `..`, i.e. one level up from the OmegaT source root. You can specify
a different directory by supplying the argument `-PassetDir=/path/to/wherever`.

In particular, with-JRE builds require a JRE tarball for the appropriate
platform, e.g. `OpenJDK11U-jre-*-macosx-x64.tar.gz`.


## Containerized Tasks

Some build tasks require additional software to be installed:

- Windows installers require InnoSetup with all optional language files.
  See [Build and test the installer package](93.BuildingInstallerPackage.md)

- Signed Windows installers require osslsigncode.
  See the [Code Signing how-to](92.CodeSigning.md)

## Working with Dependencies

OmegaT uses Gradle to manage and fetch dependencies automatically. To add,
change, or remove a dependency, see the dependencies block in build.gradle.

Dependency JARs are provided in the "source" distribution of OmegaT under
/lib/provided, as insurance in case any dependencies should become unavailable
online. When /lib/provided is present, compile-time dependencies will be
resolved locally, minimizing network access (network access is still required
for initializing the Gradle wrapper, fetching Gradle plugins, and fetching test
dependencies).


## Customized Dependencies

OmegaT uses unmodified packages as much as possible, but when modifications are
required and the upstream project is abandoned or unresponsive, custom-patched
libraries are also used.

Patched forks can be found on GitHub:
  [https://github.com/omegat-org](https://github.com/omegat-org)

In some cases (especially defunct projects) OmegaT forks are also published for
general use on Maven Central:
  [https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.omegat*](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.omegat*)

Dependencies not available for consumption via Maven/Gradle are committed to
/lib/manual.

### I want to run OmegaT with some modification

There are two major ways to build and execute OmegaT from source.

1. use application tasks

The tasks are `run`, `runOnJava17` and `runOnJava21`.
They will compile the core of OmegaT, all the modules, the First Steps documents, place module jars in the `build/modules` folder 
and launch the main function from source.
You can add command line arguments to the Gradle command with `--args="argument value"`.

Example: 
```console
./gradlew run --args="-Xmx4096M --add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt.X11=ALL-UNNAMED  -Duser.language=ja -Duser.country=JP"
```
2. use installDist task

When running `installDist` task, the OmegaT build system compiles the core of OmegaT, all the modules, the first step pages, all the bundled 
manuals, and copies the files with installed structure in `build/install/OmegaT/`.
#What is "with installed structure"?
You can open a terminal in the folder, and launch OmegaT from there.

Example:
```console
./gradlew installDist

cd build/install/OmegaT/
./OmegaT
```

### I want to build a specific module

You can use the `module::task` syntax to build the jar file for a specific module.

Example:
```console
./gradlew aligner:jar
```

When the build is finished, the `aligner-omegat.jar` file will be found in `build/modules/`.

### I want to build HTML manual in my language

There are `manualHtmlXX` tasks, here `XX` is a 2-letter language code such as En, Ca, Fr.
When you want to build html manuals in all supported languages, use `manualHtlms` instead.


## Quick OmegaT project building

We provide several ways and technics to speed up the build-and-try cycles.

### Skip containerized manual build

If you don't need to build the HTML manuals, you have 2 options:

1. If the container support software is not installed, the document building is always skipped.
2. You can use the `-PforceSkipDocumentBuild` property in Gradle command line to skip the documentation building.
-> we need a third option where the container software is not running.
   
The task execution log will record the reason why the manuals building was skipped with the "SKIPPED" label.

### Smart task execution

The OmegaT build system is configured to use Gradle task smart build features.
Once you run a build task, such as making a jar, the HTML manuals, and then modified some code, Gradle will skip all the 
unchanged parts of the project, and only compile and generate the required jar.
You will see explanatory labels in a build log. These labels are based show if a task has actions to execute,
if it should execute those actions, if it did execute those actions and if those actions made any changes.

- (no label) or EXECUTED

    Task executed its actions.

- UP-TO-DATE

    Task’s outputs did not change.

- FROM-CACHE

    Task’s outputs could be found from a previous execution.

- SKIPPED

    Task did not execute its actions.

- NO-SOURCE

    Task did not need to execute its actions.

### Modular architecture

The OmegaT project source tree is configured as a multi-project format. When building OmegaT, the Gradle build system runs
compilation and other tasks concurrently among the subprojects. OmegaT has several *modules* which are bundled plugins,
that are handled in a parallel way. Gradle will use as many cores as the computer has.

## Customizing Logging for Debugging

OmegaT uses a configuration file (`logger.properties`) to set up application logging via Java Util Logging (JUL).
You can customize logging behavior for development or debugging by providing your own configuration file and specifying it at launch.

### Default Logging Configuration

By default, OmegaT’s `logger.properties` defines logging as follows:

- **Handlers:** Both console and file logging are enabled:
  ```
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTFileHandler
  ```
- **Log Levels:** The root logger level is set to `INFO`. Most OmegaT and third-party components are set to `INFO` or `SEVERE`:
  ```
.level = INFO
org.omegat.level = ALL
org.omegat.core.data.level = INFO
cz.vutbr.web.level = SEVERE
  ```
- **Custom Formatter:** A special formatter controls log message layout (timestamp, thread, level, etc.).

- **File Logging Options:** Log files are automatically rotated by size and have retention policies:
  ```
org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTFileHandler.size=1048576
org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTFileHandler.count=30
org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTFileHandler.retention=1020000
  ```

### Changing the Log Level

You can increase the amount of detail in the logs by changing log levels in your custom `logger.properties`:

- To show debug messages for everything, set:
  ```
.level = FINE
org.omegat.level = ALL
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = FINE
org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTFileHandler.level = FINE
  ```
- To focus on a single component (e.g. `org.omegat.core.data`), set:
  ```
org.omegat.core.data.level = FINE
  ```

### Customizing Handlers and Output

- **Disable File Logging:** Remove the file handler from the handlers list:
  ```
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
  ```
- **Change the Console Log Format:** Adjust the formatter mask:
  ```
org.omegat.util.logging.OmegaTLogFormatter.mask=$time: $level: $text $key
  ```
  (You can uncomment and experiment with other mask options shown in the file.)

### Using Your Custom Configuration

1. **Save your changes to a file** (for example, `my-logger.properties`).
2. **Start OmegaT with your file:**  
   ```
java -Pjava.util.logging.config.file=/path/to/my-logger.properties -jar OmegaT.jar
   ```

### Advanced: Filtering Third-Party Logs

You can use the same file to suppress logs from other libraries used by OmegaT:
```

cz.vutbr.web.level = SEVERE
org.fit.net.level = SEVERE
```
### Tips

- Use `ALL` for maximum output, `SEVERE` for errors only.
- Logging for individual classes is possible—uncomment and adjust lines like:
  ```
#org.omegat.core.data.SaveThread.level = FINEST
  ```
- For full reference on syntax and log levels, see the [Java Logging Configuration documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/package-summary.html).

---

By customizing `logger.properties` and launching with the `-Pjava.util.logging.config.file` option,
you can tailor OmegaT’s logging to fit your debugging or development needs.
