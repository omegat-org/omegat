# Plugin Security Architecture in OmegaT

This section explains the plugin security architecture in OmegaT,
fundamental for understanding and working with its plugin system.

## Understanding ClassLoaders and Security

### What is a ClassLoader?

A **ClassLoader** in Java is responsible for loading classes into memory. Think of it as a gatekeeper that controls which classes your code can see and use. Each ClassLoader creates an isolated namespace—classes loaded by one ClassLoader cannot directly access classes loaded by another unless explicitly permitted.

### Why ClassLoaders Matter for Security

Consider the following scenarios:

1. **Single Application ClassLoader**:
```
Application ClassLoader
├── Plugin A classes
├── Plugin B classes  
└── Plugin C classes
```
   - In this setup, `Plugin A` can access and interfere with `Plugin B`'s classes.

2. **Per-Plugin ClassLoaders**:
```
Application ClassLoader
├── Plugin A ClassLoader
│   └── Plugin A classes
├── Plugin B ClassLoader  
│   └── Plugin B classes
└── Plugin C ClassLoader
└── Plugin C classes
```
   - Here, each plugin is isolated, preventing interference.

## Current Implementation

### OmegaT Design Approach

**Code snippet:**

```java
EnumMap<PluginType, MainClassLoader> MAINCLASSLOADERS;
```

- Assigns one ClassLoader per plugin type:
  - Theme plugins share a ClassLoader.
  - Language plugins share a ClassLoader.
  - Filter plugins share a ClassLoader.
  - …and so on.

### Security Implications

1. **Intra-Type Interference**: Plugins of the same type (e.g., themes) can access each other's classes.
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Different plugins using incompatible library versions can cause runtime conflicts.
3. **Fault Propagation**: A bug or memory leak in one plugin can affect all plugins of the same type.

### Practical Risks

#### Scenario 1: Malicious Plugin

A malicious plugin can:
- Access or modify other plugins' behavior within the same ClassLoader.
- Steal information processed by those plugins.

#### Scenario 2: Dependency Hell

- **Plugin A** uses Jackson library version **2.10**.
- **Plugin B** uses Jackson library version **2.15**.
- Both libraries in the same ClassLoader lead to `ClassCastException` or other issues.

#### Scenario 3: Resource Leaks

- A single plugin's memory leak could exhaust shared resources, crashing other plugins within the same ClassLoader.

## Theoretical Best Practice: Per-Plugin ClassLoader Isolation

### Industry Standard Approach

There is a best practice of the software industry standard.
It is a "Per-Plugin" classloader isolation.

Here is a code snippet to explain.

```java
public class PluginUtils {
    Map<String, ClassLoader> pluginClassLoaders = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void loadPlugins() {
        // ... several initializations
        // During plugin loading:
        for (PluginManifest manifest : manifests) {
            ClassLoader pluginClassLoader = new URLClassLoader(
                    manifest.getClasspathUrls(), getClass().getClassLoader()
            );
            pluginClassLoaders.put(manifest.getPluginId(), pluginClassLoader);
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Complete Isolation**: Plugins cannot interfere with one another.
2. **Dependency Safety**: Plugins can use distinct library versions.
3. **Fault Containment**: Failures in one plugin don't affect others.
4. **Security Boundaries**: Malicious plugins are isolated.
5. **Resource Management**: Memory leaks are contained per ClassLoader.

## Industry Best Practices

- **OSGi Framework**: Each bundle (plugin) gets its own ClassLoader
- **Eclipse Plugin System**: Plugins are isolated by default
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Plugins run in separate ClassLoaders
- **NetBeans**: Module system provides ClassLoader isolation

These systems all choose security over simplicity because plugin isolation is critical for stability and security.

## Why Per-Plugin ClassLoaders Won't Work for OmegaT

OmegaT has specific requirements that make per-plugin ClassLoader isolation impractical.

### Constraint 1: Language Module Resource Sharing

- **Problem**: Language modules must share resources like dictionaries with the core library.
- **Issue with Isolation**:
    - Resources in `Plugin A`'s ClassLoader are invisible to the core or other plugins.
- **Required Solution**:
    - A shared ClassLoader for language plugins ensures resource accessibility.

### Constraint 2: Swing UIManager Registration

- **Problem**: Theme plugins must register Look-and-Feel (LaF) classes with `UIManager`.
- **Issue with Isolation**:
    - `UIManager` requires global visibility to LaF classes, which isolated ClassLoaders cannot provide.
- **Required Solution**:
    - A shared ClassLoader for theme plugins allows LnF classes to be registered and used globally.

## Architecture Principles: Function Over Ideal Security

This highlights an architectural principle: **functional requirements constrain security design**.

- **Ideal**: Perfect plugin isolation with individual ClassLoaders.
- **Reality**: Functional requirements (e.g., resource sharing, compatibility with global Java APIs) necessitate modifications in ClassLoader strategy.

### Trade-Offs

1. **Language Modules**: Reduced isolation for shared resources.
2. **Theme Modules**: Reduced isolation for global API compatibility.
3. **Other Plugin Types**: Potential for stronger isolation (future consideration).

### Result

The **EnumMap approach** balances these constraints effectively.

---

## Design Rationale

The design employs:

```java
EnumMap<PluginType, MainClassLoader> MAINCLASSLOADERS;
```

### Why This Works

1. **Respects Functional Constraints**: Enables resource sharing and API registration where needed.
2. **Provides Reasonable Isolation**: Separate ClassLoaders for plugin types.
3. **Future Flexibility**: Other plugin types can adopt isolated ClassLoaders if requirements permit.
4. **Maintainability**: Clean mapping between plugin types and ClassLoader implementation.

### Security Analysis

1. **Risks Remaining**:
   - Intra-type plugin interference (themes, language modules).
   - Dependency conflicts and resource leakage within plugin types.
2. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Validate plugin manifests and signatures.
   - Limit resource access.
   - Use sandboxing or containerization.
   - Perform manual plugin reviews.

### Memory Impact

- **Individual ClassLoaders**: ~1MB for 20 plugins.
- **Per-Type ClassLoaders**: ~200KB regardless of the number of plugins.
- **Single ClassLoader (deprecated)**: ~50KB total.

## Lessons for Future Plugin Types

Key Questions to Consider:
1. **Does this plugin type need to share resources with the core?**
   - If yes → Shared ClassLoader.
   - If no → Individual ClassLoader possible.
2. **Does this plugin type need global API registration?**
   - If yes → Shared ClassLoader.
   - If no → Individual ClassLoader possible.
3. **Does this plugin type communicate within its type?**
   - If yes → Shared ClassLoader.
   - If no → Strong isolation recommended.

## Conclusion

The optimal solution for OmegaT's constraints. Its design:  
- Enhances security within reasonable functional limits.
- Maintains a clean code structure.
- Provides flexibility for future development.

Understanding the problem domain allows balanced trade-offs—perfect isolation may not always be possible or desirable, but thoughtful engineering still improves security significantly within practical constraints.
