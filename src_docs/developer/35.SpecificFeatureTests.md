# Test a specific features

Sometimes there are challenging targets to test when want to see the behavior of specific features in OmegaT.
There are several features that require resources, whether connecting to external services, or test data that is not 
freely available in categories of machine translation, and dictionary.

## check the behavior of Machine Translation

We have a fake MT connector project in `machinetranslator/dummy` folder.
You can build the fake connector by running `./gradlew machinetranslators:dummy:jar` and copy `dummy.jar` from
`machinetranslator/dummy/build/libs/` to `.omegat/plugins` folder. It always produces a translation text such as
"Translated result from dummy engine.". You can check OmegaT core calls engine or not by looking on the MT pane.
