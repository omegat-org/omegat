# Contributing to OmegaT documentation

Work on the OmegaT related documentation is carried out in the OmegaT repository.

The source files of manuals are in `src_docs/manual` folder.
Manual source uses the [Docbook 4.5](https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/4.5/docbook.html) format.

There are also contribution manual for developers, manual writers and translators.
The source files of contribution manual are in `src_docs/developer`
Contribution manual source uses the MarkDown, and we convert it into HTML using MkDocs processing system.
