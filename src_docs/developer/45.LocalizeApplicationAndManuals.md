# Localize applications and manuals

The localization of the OmegaT application, its manual and website is handled in the L10N project located at `https://github.com/omegat-L10N/`.

Each language subproject consists of an OmegaT team project dedicated to that particular language. OmegaT is the preferred application to contribute to localizing OmegaT.

## Requirements

Localization contributions require a github account and the most recent version of OmegaT to ensure that you can use and test the functions that are described in the source files.

## L10N Project rules and Procedures

See [Ways to contribute as an OmegaT localiser](https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N/OmegaT-L10N.github.io/blob/master/index.md) for more informations.
