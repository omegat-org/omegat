# Localize applications and manuals

Welcome!
This guide will help you contribute to the translation (localization) of the OmegaT application, its manual, and website.
Don't worry if you're new to translating software â€” OmegaT is a beginner-friendly tool, and this guide simplifies the process for you.

## Overview of Localization Projects

Localization of OmegaT is managed in the **L10N Project** at [https://github.com/omegat-L10N/](https://github.com/omegat-L10N/).

- **OmegaT is localized into 37 languages** (the program interface and menus).
- The documentation is translated into 36 languages.
- The OmegaT website is available in 29 languages.

## Why Help Translate OmegaT?

By contributing translations to OmegaT, you help expand access to this useful tool to people in your language community.
Additionally:

- Translation can be done directly in OmegaT itself, making it easy and efficient.
- No technical or coding knowledge is required, and youâ€™ll be fully supported throughout the process.

## Getting Started

### What You Need:

1. **GitHub Account**: Create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com/).
2. **Latest OmegaT Version**: Download OmegaT from [OmegaT downloads page](https://omegat.org/download).

_Good news!_ You don't need prior experience with Git, version control, or developer tools.

### How to Start:

**1. Contact the Localization Manager**
- Email the manager (via the details in your project or community) with:
    - The language you want to translate.
    - Your GitHub username.

- Wait for the invitation to your team repository on GitHub.

**2. Accept the GitHub Invitation**
- You will be added to the GitHub repository for your chosen language.
- This is where the translation files are stored and managed.

**3. Download the Localization Project in OmegaT**
- Open OmegaT â†’ Click **Project** â†’ **Download Team Project**.
- Enter the project URL provided (e.g., ). `https://github.com/OmegaT-L10N/XX.git`
- Choose a local folder where the project will save files on your computer.

**4. Translator Login**
- If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password in OmegaT.
- If you use two-factor authentication for GitHub, you'll need to generate a Personal Access Token (a GitHub security feature).

## Translation Process
1. Open the downloaded project in OmegaT.
2. Translate the text strings in the files (e.g., menu labels, user documentation).
3. Save your progress. OmegaT will check for updates to ensure you work on the latest files.

### Testing Translations
Before submitting your translations, test how they look in OmegaT.
1. **Create Target Files**: From OmegaT, click `Project` â†’ `Create Target Files`. Your translated files will be stored in the **Target Files** folder.
2. Locate the file in the Target folder (where `xx` is your language code). `Bundle_xx.properties`
3. Test the file in OmegaT:
    - Linux: Adjust the startup script to include . `--resource-bundle=/path/to/Bundle_xx.properties`
    - Windows: Edit the file and add `--resource-bundle=path\to\Bundle_xx.properties` at the end. `OmegaT.l4J.ini`
    - MacOS: Modify in to include the resource bundle parameter. `Configuration.properties``OmegaT.app`

## Finishing and Submitting Translations
1. Write to the localization manager when your translations are complete. Include the names of the files you've translated.
2. If partial translations (e.g., incomplete files) are not allowed for a release, wait until your files are finished before submission.

_Note_: Occasionally, the localization manager may connect you with other team members to coordinate efforts and minimize duplication.

## License Information

OmegaT and all its localization files are distributed under the **GPL v3 License**.
This ensures that the software and translations remain free and open for everyone.
