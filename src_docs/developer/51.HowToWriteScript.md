# How to Write an OmegaT Script

OmegaT provides a powerful scripting feature that allows users and developers to automate tasks, extend the application's functionality, and interact with the translation project and the GUI.

## Introduction

OmegaT scripts use the JSR-223 (Scripting for the Java™ Platform) API. This means any language with a JSR-223 compliant engine can be used, although Groovy and JavaScript are supported out of the box.

## Script Locations

There are two primary locations where OmegaT looks for scripts:

1.  **User-defined Script Directory**: This is the primary location for your scripts. You can configure this directory in **Tools > Scripting...**. By default, it is the `scripts` folder in OmegaT's installation or working directory.
2.  **OmegaT Configuration Script Directory**: Located at `<configDir>/script` (e.g., `~/.omegat/script` on Linux). This directory is mainly used for internal data exchange (see [Interaction with SegmentExportImport](#interaction-with-segmentexportimport)).

## Supported Languages

-   **Groovy (`.groovy`)**: The recommended language for OmegaT scripts. It has excellent integration with Java and is widely used in the OmegaT community.
-   **JavaScript (`.js`)**: Supported via the built-in Nashorn (in older Java versions) or GraalJS engines.
-   **Other languages**: You can add support for other languages (like Python or Ruby) by placing the corresponding JSR-223 engine JAR files into the OmegaT `lib` or `plugins` folder.

## Global Bindings

When a script is executed, several global variables are automatically made available:

| Variable | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `project` | The current translation project. | `ITranslationProject` |
| `editor` | The editor component. | `IEditor` |
| `glossary` | The glossary management component. | `IGlossaries` |
| `mainWindow` | The main application window. | `IMainWindow` |
| `Core` | Access to the `org.omegat.core.Core` class. | `Class<Core>` |
| `console` | A logger for printing messages and clearing the output area in the Scripting Window. | `IScriptLogger` |
| `res` | A `ResourceBundle` for the script (if localized). | `ResourceBundle` |

You can use `console.println("Message")` to print to the Scripting Window's output area.

## Script Metadata and Localization

You can provide a name and description for your scripts, which will be shown in the Scripting Window.

### Embedded Metadata
Add the following tags in a comment at the beginning of your script:
```groovy
// :name = My Custom Script
// :description = This script performs a specific task.
```

### Localization via Properties
Create a `properties/` subdirectory in your script folder and add a `.properties` file with the same name as your script (e.g., `MyScript.groovy` -> `properties/MyScript.properties`).
Available keys:
- `name`: The localized name of the script.
- `description`: The localized description.

## Event-Driven Scripts

OmegaT can automatically trigger scripts when specific events occur. To use this, place your scripts in a subdirectory of your **User-defined Script Directory** named after the event.

In addition to the [Global Bindings](#global-bindings), event-driven scripts receive specific variables depending on the event:

| Directory Name | Trigger Event | Additional Bindings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `application_startup` | Shortly after OmegaT starts. | (none) |
| `application_shutdown` | When OmegaT is closing. | (none) |
| `entry_activated` | When a new segment is activated. | `newEntry` (`SourceTextEntry`) |
| `new_file` | When a new file is loaded. | `activeFileName` (`String`) |
| `new_word` | When a new word is detected. | `newWord` (`String`) |
| `project_changed` | When the project state changes. | `eventType` (`PROJECT_CHANGE_TYPE`) |

Scripts in these folders are executed in alphabetical order.

## GUI and Threading

By default, scripts run in a separate thread to avoid freezing the OmegaT interface. However, if your script needs to interact with Swing components (the GUI), those operations must run on the **Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)**.

OmegaT simplifies this: if you define a function named `gui`, it will be automatically called on the EDT after the main body of the script has finished executing.

```groovy
def gui() {
    // This code runs on the EDT
    javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello from the EDT!")
}

// Main script logic runs here (non-EDT)
console.println("Script is running...")
```

## Interaction with SegmentExportImport

The `SegmentExportImport` feature allows external tools and scripts to interact with OmegaT's content via text files in the **OmegaT Configuration Script Directory** (`<configDir>/script`). These files provide a simple way to access OmegaT content and process it with local programs such as shell scripts.

-   **`source.txt`**: Contains the original text of the current segment. The text in the file is replaced each time a new segment is entered, provided that the **Export the segment to text files** preference is enabled (**Options > Preferences > Editor**).
-   **`target.txt`**: Contains the translated text of the current segment. The text in the file is replaced each time a new segment is entered, provided that the **Export the segment to text files** preference is enabled.
-   **`selection.txt`**: Stores the currently selected text when **Edit > Export Selection** is used. The text in the file is replaced each time this function is called.
-   **`import.txt`**: If an external process writes to this file, OmegaT will automatically read its content and replace the current segment's translation with it.

## Example: A Simple Groovy Script

```groovy
// :name = Hello World
// :description = Greets the user and prints project info.

import javax.swing.JOptionPane

console.println("Hello from Groovy!")
console.println("Current project: " + project.projectProperties.projectName)

def gui() {
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello, OmegaT user!")
}
```
