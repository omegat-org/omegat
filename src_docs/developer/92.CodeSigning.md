# Code signing How-To

## What is code signing and why is it required?

### Windows

Code signing provides benefits to application security features
like Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC).
It allows the system to cryptographically verify that a file hasn't 
been tampered with before any code is to run.

Windows doesn't require software developers to digitally sign their code.
Users can install applications from sites other than the Microsoft Store if they allow such applications to run.
When code sign is provided, Windows reduces the number of warnings when running.

### macOS

“On devices with macOS 10.15, all apps distributed outside the App
Store must be signed by the developer using an Apple-issued Developer
ID certificate (combined with a private key) and notarized by Apple to
run under the default Gatekeeper settings. Apps developed in-house
should also be signed with an Apple-issued Developer ID so that users
can validate their integrity.”

Starting with OmegaT 6.0.2, OmegaT is distributed as a notarized
application for both the old Intel CPU machines and the new Apple CPU
machines (starting with M1).

## How to obtain a certificate?

A certificate can be obtained from certification authority companies.
Both Microsoft and Apple specify which companies are compatible with
their respective platforms.

### Windows

Many certification authority companies provide a certification for code
signing for Windows.

#### Certum Open Source developer certificate program

Certum(r) is one of the certification authority services provided by Asseco Ltd.

They provide discounted a code signing certificate to FOSS projects.
They not only check developer individual identities but also check the project itself. 

#### Comodo certificate for individuals

Comodo provides a certification with affordable prices for individuals.


### macOS

Apple is the only authority that provides a certification for code
signing and notarization. The certification comes with an Apple
Developper account.

#### Certificate issued by Apple

A developper account comes with an Apple verified developper ID.

#### Application notarized by Apple

Apple provides the notarization service based on the Apple verified
developper ID.

## Tools

### Windows

#### signtool.exe

`signtool.exe` is a utility bundled with Windows SDK. 
SignTool is a command-line tool that digitally signs files, 
verifies the signatures in files, and time stamps files.

The tool is installed in the `\Bin` folder of the Microsoft Windows SDK installation path,
for example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x64\signtool.exe`.

### Linux

#### osslsigntool

osslsigncode is a small tool that implements part of the functionality of 
the Microsoft tool signtool.exe - more exactly the Authenticode signing and timestamping. 
osslsigncode is based on OpenSSL and cURL, and thus should be able to compile on most 
platforms where the commands exist.

See [https://sourceforge.net/projects/osslsigncode/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/osslsigncode/) for more informations.

#### OpenSC

OpenSC is an open source smart card tools and middleware.
It supports PKCS#11/MiniDriver/Tokend.

The list of supported hardware is at 
[OpenSC Wiki](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Supported-hardware-%28smart-cards-and-USB-tokens%29).


#### openssl-pkcs11


### macOS
