# Git repository analysis

## Analyze Development Progresses

To get a sense of how much has changed in the codebase, you can run

```sh
git diff --numstat v6.0.1..master | tail -1
```

This reports at the certain commit on the working directory such as:

```
4003 files changed, 1,672,495 insertions(+), 674,322 deletions(-)
```

## Analyze contributions

You can also analyze the repository in detail. OmegaT project has a tiny script to analyze
the repository per-author for main code and test code.

You can run `bash ci/git-code-analysis.sh`, the you will get like

```bash
$ bash ci/git-code-analysis.sh 
Analyzing contributions since tag: v5.8.0 on branch: master

== Per-author contribution in MAIN code ==
--- A developer name ---
Commits: 141
Lines added: 553, Lines removed: 213
Files changed: 21

--- B developer name ---

... and so on.

```
