# ADR: Manual Build and Distribution for OmegaT

## Status
**Accepted** – Partially Implemented

## Context

The OmegaT project currently includes user manuals as part of its distribution.
These manuals are stored as HTML files in language-specific subfolders located under the `docs` directory.
This setup presents several challenges:

1. **Large Distribution Size**:
    - The inclusion of manual files significantly increases the distribution size.
    - Redundant or unused assets—such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files—contribute to unnecessary bloat.

2. **Accessibility**:
    - A proposed online manual aims to improve accessibility for users who prefer web access.
    - However, OmegaT is designed to function offline, requiring offline manual access for core functionality.

3. **Localization Inefficiencies**:
    - Bundling language-specific resources (e.g., spellchecking dictionaries) with localized manuals is currently inefficient.

4. **Build System Complexity**:
    - Manual builds rely on outdated tools (e.g., DocBook 4.5, XSLT 1.0, and Saxon 6).
    - The build process utilizes containerization, which reduces performance and consumes developer PC disk space.

5. **Repository Size Issues**:
    - Owing to the low performance of the manual build process, the project stores prebuilt HTML files in the repository.
    - This practice inflates the repository size, increases download requirements for developers,
       and creates potential inconsistencies between source files and built artifacts.

## Decision

To address these issues, the following decisions have been made regarding manual distribution and the build process:

1. **Distribution of Manuals as ZIP Archives**:
    - Manuals will be packaged as ZIP files containing HTML files, optimized assets (images, CSS, JavaScript), and related language tools (e.g., spellchecking dictionaries).
    - Manuals will be extracted temporarily from ZIP files when accessed via `Help > Manual` in OmegaT or used offline for local browsing.

2. **Improved Accessibility**:
    - Manuals will be accessible via the OmegaT website for those who prefer online browsing.
    - Offline access will remain available to ensure core functionality is preserved for offline users.

3. **Modernized Build System**:
    - Replace the current container-based build process with a Gradle-based system.
    - Legacy dependencies (e.g., Saxon and DocBook) will be updated and repackaged in OmegaT's Maven repository.

4. **Updated Folder Structure**:
    - Restructure documentation files into a Gradle-compatible format (e.g., `src/docs/manual/<lang>`).
    - Align Java source files (`src/`) and testing files (`test/`) with Maven/Gradle directory layout standards (`src/main/java`, `src/test/java`).
    - Now it is interim status that is located in `src_docs` instead of `src/docs/` and keep `src/` and `tset/` folders.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Reduced Distribution Size**:
    - Switching to ZIP distribution minimizes distribution size by removing unnecessary and redundant files.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**:
    - Users can choose between online and offline manuals, enhancing flexibility for different scenarios.
- **Improved Developer Workflow**:
    - A Gradle-based system simplifies the build process and aligns with modern development practices.
- **Optimized Resources**:
    - Shared assets (CSS, JS) and better-optimized images reduce file duplication and repository size.
- **Future Scalability**:
    - A modular Gradle-based build system enables easier updates and enhancements.

### Drawbacks

- **Increased Build Complexity**:
    - Developers must familiarize themselves with Gradle and updated workflows, introducing a temporary learning curve.
- **Refactoring Effort**:
    - Migration involves restructuring the existing source, test, and documentation directories.
- **ZIP Expansion in User Folder**:
    - Manuals will be extracted into the user folder when accessed via the `Help` menu. These files can then be bookmarked in the user's preferred browser.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Retain the Current System**:
    - Pros: No new development required.
    - Cons: Fails to address distribution size, accessibility, and workflow challenges.

2. **Fully Web-Based Documentation**:
    - Pros: Simplifies distribution entirely.
    - Cons: Removes offline functionality, which is vital for some users.

3. **Remove Manuals from the Distribution**:
    - Pros: Significantly reduces the distribution size.
    - Cons: Severely impacts usability for offline users.

## Implementation Details

1. **Manual Build Workflow**:
    - Gradle will generate:
        - Language-specific ZIP archives for manual distribution.
        - Extracted HTML manuals for testing and development purposes.
    - Required libraries (e.g., Saxon, Libstemmer) will be hosted on OmegaT’s Maven repository.

2. **Manual Updates and Packaging**:
    - Developers will contribute manual updates in an XML DocBook format.
    - Zipped manual archives will be published alongside OmegaT releases.

3. **Updated Folder Structure**:
    - Manual source files will be located at: `src/docs/manual/<lang>/`.
    - Gradle build scripts (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`) will reflect the new structure.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Backward Compatibility**:
    - Legacy manuals will be bundled in default language ZIP files to ensure accessibility.
    - Documentation will explain offline usage and ZIP file extraction.
- **Tooling Compatibility**:
    - Extensive testing will ensure compatibility across all supported operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Adoption Plan

1. Migrate existing manual sources to the updated Gradle-compatible folder structure (`src/docs/manual/`).
2. Develop Gradle build scripts to automate manual generation and testing workflows.
3. With OmegaT's next release, distribute language-specific manual ZIP files to users.
