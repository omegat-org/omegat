## Context
OmegaT stores its internal translation memory in a file called `project_save.tmx`. 
Historically, this file has included a DOCTYPE declaration for TMX 1.1 (e.g., `<!DOCTYPE tmx SYSTEM "tmx11.dtd">`).
While this implies TMX conformance, the file is:
- Meant for internal use,

Separately, recent reviews of our test infrastructure revealed that:
- Many functional test TMX files mix TMX 1.1 and 1.4 constructs,
- Files that should be invalid are accepted without error,
- Our `TMXReader2` uses StAX, which **does not support DTD validation**.

These two concerns are interrelated and raise key questions:
- What TMX version should OmegaT use internally?
- How should we validate internal and external TMX files?
- How strict should we be in parsing vs exporting?

### Extended Discussion from Development List

Recent discussions have clarified several important technical and architectural points:

**Hiroshi's Technical Clarification (2025-07-15):**
- OmegaT no longer relies on DTDs for XML processing for parsing and validating TMX files
- XSD offers more precise validation, better namespace handling, and avoids DTD security issues (e.g., XXE attacks)
- The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration in `project_save.tmx` can sometimes be misleading for users opening files in validating editors like OxygenXML if they don’t have a copy of the DTD.
- OmegaT supports TMX export with DTDs for external tool compatibility but doesn't use DTD-based validation internally

**Philippe's User Experience Perspective (2025-07-15):**
- Internal handling methods shouldn't dictate output file format decisions
- Removing DOCTYPE while keeping TMX format would confuse users examining file content
- Users won't interpret missing DOCTYPE as "internal use only" - they expect compliant TMX files
- Short-term focus should be ensuring schema compliance rather than format changes

**Performance and Scalability Concerns (khagaroth, 2025-07-16):**
- Questioned whether XML is appropriate for working data storage, especially for frequently changing content
- Performance issues with larger projects highlight potential need for alternative storage formats
- Current XML format doesn't scale well for bigger projects without splitting

**Thomas's Storage vs. Exchange Perspective (2025-07-16):**
- Emphasized that `project_save.tmx` is primarily used for **storage**, not for exchange
- Need to balance current storage structure with features that might be required in the future

## Options

All the options need to consider backward compatibility. We do not know which version of OmegaT a given user is using. We need to have a reasonable number of old versions that still can understand new projects, and reciprocally.

### Option A: Treat `project_save.tmx` as Internal and Drop DOCTYPE
Remove the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration from `project_save.tmx`, clarify in documentation that it's for OmegaT's internal use only, and not necessarily TMX-compliant.

#### Pros
- Prevents confusion in validating editors
- Frees internal format from TMX limitations
- Easier to evolve for OmegaT-specific needs
- Aligns with XSD-based processing architecture

#### Cons
- Reduces compatibility with external tools
- Undermines the assumption that `project_save.tmx` is a reliable backup/exchange file
- May confuse users who expect TMX compliance from TMX-named files

---

### Option B: Make `project_save.tmx` Strictly TMX 1.4b Compliant
Update `project_save.tmx` to fully conform to TMX 1.4b Level 2, using compliant tagging, encoding, and schema validation.

#### Pros
- Promotes interoperability and correctness
- Simplifies reuse by other tools
- Aligns with exported `-level2.tmx` files
- Meets user expectations for TMX file compliance

#### Cons
- Adds validation overhead and migration costs
- Risks breaking compatibility for existing users/projects
- TMX 1.4b is not extensible (no `<custom>` tags, etc.)

---

### Option C: Replace with an Alternative Internal Format (e.g., SQLite)
Use a non-TMX format (e.g., SQLite or custom binary XML) for internal storage.
Retain TMX exports for interoperability only.

#### Pros
- Supports rich internal metadata and faster saves
- Clean separation between internal state and exchange formats
- Enables backward-compatible export options
- Addresses performance and scalability concerns raised in discussions

#### Cons
- Loss of human-readable internal format
- Tooling and migration burden
- May require file format version negotiation
- Significant architectural change requiring careful user communication

---

### Option D: Dual Strategy for TMX Validation
Improve TMX handling by adopting **strict schema-based validation** for external files and lenient parsing for trusted internal data.
Use converted **XSD schemas** instead of DTDs for validation.

#### Pros
- Provides reliable TMX file validation across 1.1 and 1.4b versions
- Enhances test coverage and correctness (PR #1559)
- Maintains performance by keeping StAX as the primary parser
- Aligns with XSD-based architecture

#### Cons
- Requires maintenance of XSD schema files
- Some legacy test files may need to be rewritten
- Developers must be aware of different validation modes for internal/external files

---

### Option E: Hybrid Approach - Remove DOCTYPE, Add XSD Validation
1. Remove `DOCTYPE` element while keeping TMX format (`<tmx version="1.1">`)
2. Validate `project_save.tmx` with TMX 1.1 XSD when reading

#### Pros
- Leverages existing XSD validation infrastructure (PR #1559)
- Provides path for future modernization
- Reduces editor confusion while maintaining compliance

#### Cons
- Questions remain about XML schema references in `<tmx>` element

---

## Implementation Notes

- A pull request [#1559](https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat/pull/1559) has implemented schema-based validation for TMX files using XSDs and demonstrates reading valid TMX without DOCTYPE
- Tests like `AutoTmxTest` and `TMXReaderTest` currently contain files that:
    - Mix versions (e.g., TMX 1.1 with `xml:lang` from 1.4)
    - Omit required attributes (e.g., `pos` on `<it>`)
    - Pass incorrectly due to the absence of validation
- OmegaT's TMXReader uses StAX, which **cannot validate against DTD**; schema validation is the only reliable approach
- Development discussions reveal tension between storage efficiency and exchange format expectations

---

## Recommendation Path

Based on extended discussions, we propose a refined staged approach:

1. **Immediate (Technical Debt Reduction)**
    - Adopt Option D: Implement XSD-based validation for external TMX files based on PR #1559
    - Review and correct non-conforming test data
    - Document current `project_save.tmx` behavior and limitations

2. **Short-Term (Consistency and User Experience)**
    - Evaluate Option E: Remove misleading DOCTYPE while maintaining XSD validation
    - Consider Philippe's concern about user expectations vs. Hiroshi's technical clarity
    - Gather broader community feedback on format change communication

3. **Medium-Term (Architecture Decision)**
    - Decide between continued TMX evolution (Option B) vs. internal format separation (Option A)
    - Address performance concerns raised by khagaroth through optimization or format change
    - Clarify storage vs. exchange role per Thomas's observations

4. **Long-Term (Scalability and Performance)**
    - Evaluate Option C if storage performance becomes critical
    - Consider hybrid approaches that maintain TMX exports while using efficient internal storage

---

## Community Perspectives Summary

- **Technical Architecture (Hiroshi)**: Favor XSD over DTD, remove misleading DOCTYPE, align with modern XML processing
- **User Experience (Philippe)**: Maintain TMX compliance expectations, avoid confusing format changes
- **Performance (khagaroth)**: Question XML suitability for working storage, consider scalability
- **Purpose Clarity (Thomas)**: Distinguish storage from exchange usage, acknowledge evolved user expectations

---

## Open Questions

- Should `project_save.tmx` always be readable by older OmegaT versions?
- What level of strictness should be enforced on `tm/auto/*.tmx` and user-imported memories?
- Do we want to support TMX 1.2 or 1.3 in practice?
- Can schema validation be extended to all TMX processing (including project merge, team sync)?
- How should we communicate format changes to users who rely on `project_save.tmx` for external processing?
- Should we include XML schema references in the `<tmx xmlns="http://www.lisa.org/tmx14">` element if removing DOCTYPE?

This ADR consolidates architectural concerns about internal format design, TMX standard conformance, and test validation robustness.
It incorporates community perspectives on technical architecture, user experience, performance, and purpose clarity. 
The document is open for review and intended as a base for community agreement before implementation.
