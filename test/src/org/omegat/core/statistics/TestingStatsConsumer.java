import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

/**
 * A consumer class implementing the {@code IStatsConsumer} interface for testing purposes.
 * This class is designed primarily to assist in unit tests by recording table data and notifying
 * the completion of data processing.
 *
 * It does not perform any actual data manipulation or display tasks, and most
 * interface methods are effectively no-ops except for a few methods as described below.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Captures and stores table data provided via the {@code setTable} method.
 * - Signals the completion of data processing using a {@code CompletableFuture}.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - This class is not explicitly thread-safe. Concurrent access to its methods
 *   may lead to undefined behavior.
 *
 * Methods Overview:
 * - {@code setTable(String[] headers, String[][] data)}: Stores the provided table data.
 * - {@code finishData()}: Completes the provided {@code CompletableFuture}, notifying listeners of completion.
 * - Other methods from {@code IStatsConsumer} do not perform any actions.
