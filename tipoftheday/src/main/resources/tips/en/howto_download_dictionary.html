<h3 class="title">Dictionary</h3>
<p>OmegaT supports dictionaries in the StarDict or in the Lingvo DSL
format. You can find some dictionaries on the <a class="ulink"
                                                 href="https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/wiki/Reference%20Material/"
                                                 target="_blank">OmegaT Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>To install dictionaries:</p>
<div class="orderedlist">
    <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
        <li class="listitem">
            <p>download the file - it should be a tarball archive (extension
                <code class="filename">tar.bz</code> or <code class="filename">tar.bz2</code>),</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
            <p>extract its contents into this folder. There should be three files
                per dictionary, with extensions <code class="filename">dz</code>,
                <code class="filename">idx</code> and <code class="filename">ifo</code>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>If you want to remove words from potential dictionary matches, add an
    <code class="filename">ignore.txt</code> encoded in UTF-8 to the folder. The file
    must have one word per line. All the words contained in that list will be
    ignored by OmegaT.</p>
